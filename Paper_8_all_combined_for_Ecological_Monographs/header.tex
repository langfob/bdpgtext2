%  This chunk and the pdf_document header lines:

%  are hacks to keep knitting to a pdf from blowing up with the 
%  following message due to a known bug in pandoc:

%  I found this solution at:
%      Horizontal rule in R Markdown / Bookdown causing errors
%          https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58587918/horizontal-rule-in-r-markdown-bookdown-causing-errors 
%
%  On 2020 01 05, I tried replacing the current pandoc that knitr uses (version 2.3.1) 
%  with the latest version of pandoc (version 2.9.1).  While that does 
%  fix this problem, it blows up in a completely different way that I have 
%  not been able to find a way to fix, so I'm going with this hack.  
%  I will have to use this hack in EVERY file I want to knit that uses  
%  markdown's "---" to specify a horizontal line.

%  Note that the comment lines in this chunk must be marked with "%" instead 
%  of "#" because they're going to be included in the latex header.tex file 
%  and "%" is the latex comment marker.
