Rather intriguingly, experimental results with various models for generating random CSP instances suggest a "threshold-like" behavior and some theoretical work has been done in analyzing these models when the number of variables becomes large (asymptotic). In this paper we prove that the models commonly used for generating random CSP instances do not have an asymptotic threshold. In particular, we prove that as the number of variables becomes large, almost all instances they generate are trivially overconstrained. We then present a new model for random CSP and, in the spirit of random k-SAT, we derive lower and upper bounds for its parameters so that instances are "almost surely" underconstrained and overconstrained, respectively.},

  abstract = {A major difficulty in evaluating incomplete local search style algorithms for constraint satisfaction problems is the need for a source of hard problem instances that are guaranteed to be satisfiable. A standard approach to evaluate incomplete search methods has been to use a general problem generator and a complete search method to filter out the unsatisfiable instances. Unfortunately, this approach cannot be used to create problem instances that are beyond the reach of complete search methods. So far, it has proven to be surprisingly difficult to develop a direct generator for satisfiable instances only. In this paper, we propose a generator that only outputs satisfiable problem instances. We also show how one can finely control the hardness of the satisfiable instances by establishing a connection between problem hardness and a new kind of phase transition phenomenon in the space of problem instances. Finally, we use our problem distribution to show the easy-hard-easy pattern in search complexity for local search procedures, analogous to the previously reported pattern for complete search methods.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of incomplete satisfiability solvers depends critically on the availability of hard satisfiable instances. A plausible source of such instances consists of random kSAT formulas whose clauses are chosen uniformly from among all clauses satisfying some randomly chosen truth assignment A. Unfortunately, instances generated in this manner tend to be relatively easy and can be solved efficiently by practical heuristics. Roughly speaking, for a number of different algorithms, A acts as a stronger and stronger attractor as the formula's density increases. Motivated by recent results on the geometry of the space of satisfying truth assignments of random k-SAT and NAE-k-SAT formulas, we introduce a simple twist on this basic model, which appears to dramatically increase its hardness. Namely, in addition to forbidding the clauses violated by the hidden assignment A, we also forbid the clauses violated by its complement, so that both A and A are satisfying. It appears that under this ``symmetrization'' the effects of the two attractors largely cancel out, making it much harder for algorithms to find any truth assignment. We give theoretical and experimental evidence supporting this assertion.},

Hand-written instances are of limited utility and are timeconsuming to produce. A common method for generating instances is constructing special purpose programs for each class of problems. This can be better than manually producing instances, but developing such instance generators also has drawbacks. In this paper, we present a method for generating graded instances completely automatically starting from a class-level problem specification. A graded instance in our present setting is one which is neither too easy nor too difficult for a given solver. We start from an abstract problem specification written in the Essence language and provide a system to transform the problem specification, via automated type-specific rewriting rules, into a new abstract specification which we call a generator specification. The generator specification is itself parameterised by a number of integer parameters; these are used to characterise a certain region of the parameter space. The solutions of each such generator instance form valid problem instances. We use the parameter tuner irace to explore the space of possible generator parameters, aiming to find parameter values that yield graded instances. We perform an empirical evaluation of our system for five problem classes from CSPlib, demonstrating promising results.},

Systematic conservation planning (SCP) frameworks provide tools to identify and implement conservation areas effectively and efficiently but rarely address issues central to lower-income countries, which limits SCP's usefulness in these settings. This paper reviews SCP and discusses how to make SCP more relevant in lowerincome countries. Lower-income countries have small conservation budgets, imperfect measures of conservation costs and benefits, and unique institutions that all influence the siting, management, and implementation of protected area networks. In addition, these aspects of the lower-income country setting inform the reaction of people to a protected area, which determines the conservation effectiveness of the protected areas. Overall, the institutional and socioeconomic settings of lower-income countries create additional layers of complexity that should be incorporated into SCP frameworks at the stage of selecting reserve sites to improve the efficiency of conservation policies.},

Consequently, these protected areas may fail to achieve their intended goal. We present and solve a spatial bio-economic model in which a manager chooses the optimal location, size, and enforcement level of a marine protected area (MPA). This manager acts as a Stackelberg leader, and her choices consider villagers' best response to the MPA in a spatial Nash equilibrium of fishing site and effort decisions. Relevant to lower income country settings but general to other settings, we incorporate limited enforcement budgets, distance costs of traveling to fishing sites, and labor allocation to onshore wage opportunities. The optimal MPA varies markedly across alternative manager goals and budget sizes, but always induce changes in villagers' decisions as a function of distance, dispersal, and wage. We consider MPA managers with ecological conservation goals and with economic goals, and identify the shortcomings of several common manager decision rules, including those focused on: (1) fishery outcomes rather than broader economic goals, (2) fish stocks at MPA sites rather than across the full marinescape, (3) absolute levels rather than additional values, and (4) costless enforcement. Our results demonstrate that such na\"ive or overly narrow decision rules can lead to inefficient MPA designs that miss economic and conservation opportunities.},

Automatic kernel selection is a key issue given the number of kernels available, and the current trial-and-error nature of selecting the best kernel for a given problem. This paper introduces a new method for automatic kernel selection, with empirical results based on classification. The empirical study has been conducted among five kernels with 112 different classification problems, using the popular kernel based statistical learning algorithm SVM. We evaluate the kernels' performance in terms of accuracy measures. We then focus on answering the question: which kernel is best suited to which type of classification problem? Our meta-learning methodology involves measuring the problem characteristics using classical, distance and distribution-based statistical information. We then combine these measures with the empirical results to present a rule-based method to select the most appropriate kernel for a classification problem.

  abstract = {The intensity of human pressure on marine systems has led to a push for stronger marine conservation efforts. Recently, marine reserves have become one highly advocated form of marine conservation, and the number of newly designated reserves has increased dramatically. Reserves will be essential for conservation efforts because they can provide unique protection for critical areas, they can provide a spatial escape for intensely exploited species, and they can potentially act as buffers against some management miscalculations and unforeseen or unusual conditions. Reserve design and effectiveness can be dramatically improved by better use of existing scientific understanding. Reserves are insufficient protection alone, however, because they are not isolated from all critical impacts. Communities residing within marine reserves are strongly influenced by the highly variable conditions of the water masses that continuously flow through them. To a much greater degree than in terrestrial systems, the scales of fundamental processes, such as population replenishment, are often much larger than reserves can encompass. Further, they offer no protection from some important threats, such as contamination by chemicals. Therefore, without adequate protection of species and ecosystems outside reserves, effectiveness of reserves will be severely compromised. We outline conditions under which reserves are likely to be effective, provide some guidelines for increasing their conservation potential, and suggest some research priorities to fill critical information gaps. We strongly support vastly increasing the number and size of marine reserves; at the same time, strong conservation efforts outside reserves must complement this effort. To date, most reserve design and site selection have involved little scientific justification. They must begin to do so to increase the likelihood of attaining conservation objectives.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem stays far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Through the interactions among biotic and abiotic components, and encompassing physical environments, ecosystem forms a dissipative structure that allows it to dissipate energy continuously and thereby remains functional over time. Biotic regulation of energy and material fluxes in and out of the ecosystem allows it to maintain a homeostatic state which corresponds to a self-organized state emerged in a non-equilibrium thermodynamic system. While the associated self-organizational processes approach to homeostatic state, entropy (a measure of irreversibility) degrades and dissipation of energy increases. We propose here that at a homeostatic state of ecosystem, biodiversity which includes both phenotypic and functional diversity, attains optimal values. As long as biodiversity remains within its optimal range, the corresponding homeostatic state is maintained. However, while embedded environmental conditions fluctuate along the gradient of accelerating changes, phenotypic diversity and functional diversity contribute inversely to the associated self-organizing processes. Furthermore, an increase or decrease in biodiversity outside of its optimal range makes the ecosystem vulnerable to transition into a different state.},

Here, we present a noise-canceling network model that relates noisy physiological conditions, power conversion efficiency, and the resulting absorption spectra of photosynthetic organisms. Using light conditions in full solar exposure, light filtered by oxygenic phototrophs, and light filtered under seawater, we derived optimal absorption characteristics for efficient solar power conversion. We show how light-harvesting antennae can be tuned to maximize power conversion efficiency by minimizing excitation noise, thus providing a unified theoretical basis for the observed wavelength dependence of absorption in green plants, purple bacteria, and green sulfur bacteria.},

Simulated data based on a known probability distribution, though, can be used to evaluate statistical methods. Models should estimate true selection patterns if they are to be useful in analyzing and interpreting field data. We used simulation techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of three statistical methods used in modeling resource selection. We generated 25 use locations per animal and included 10, 20, 40, or 80 animals in samples of use locations. To simulate species of different mobility, we generated use locations at four levels according to a known probability distribution across DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR) in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, USA. We either generated 5 random locations per use location or 10,000 random locations (total) within 4 predetermined areas around use locations to determine how the definition of availability and the number of random locations affected results. We analyzed simulated data using discrete choice, logisticregression, and a maximum entropy method (Maxent). We used a simple linear regression of estimated and known probability distributions and area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) to evaluate the performance of each method. Each statistical method was affected differently by number of animals and random locations used in analyses, level at which selection of resources occurred, and area considered available. Discrete-choice modeling resulted in precise and accurate estimates of the true probability distribution when the area in which use locations were generated was {$\geq$} the area defined to be available. Logistic-regression models were unbiased and precise when the area in which use locations were generated and the area defined to be available were the same size; the fit of these models improved with increased numbers of random locations. Maxent resulted in unbiased and precise estimates of the known probability distribution when the area in which use locations were generated was small (homerange level) and the area defined to be available was large (study area). Based on AUC analyses, all models estimated the selection distribution better than random chance. Results from AUC analyses, however, often contradicted results of the linear regression method used to evaluate model performance. Discretechoice modeling was best able to estimate the known selection distribution in our study area regardless of sample size or number of random locations used in the analyses, but we recommend further studies using simulated data over different landscapes and different resource metrics to confirm our results. Our study offers an approach and guidance for others interested in assessing the utility of techniques for modeling resource selection in their study area.},

This results in PBIL being simpler, both computationally and theoretically, than the GA. Empirical results reported elsewhere show that PBIL is faster and more effective than the GA on a large set of commonly used benchmark problems. Here we present results on a problem custom designed to benefit both from the GA's crossover operator and from its use of a population. The results show that PBIL performs as well as, or better than, GAs carefully tuned to do well on this problem. This suggests that even on problems custom designed for GAs, much of the power of the GA may derive from the statistics maintained implicitly in its population, and not from the population itself nor from the crossover operator.},

  abstract = {While efforts to meet international commitments to counter biodiversity declines by establishing networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) continue, assessments of MPAs rarely take into account measures of effectiveness of different categories of protection, or other design principles (size, spacing, governance considerations). We carried out a meta-analysis of ecological effectiveness of IUCN Categories I\textendash II (no-take), IV and VI (MPAs) compared to unprotected areas. We then applied our ecological effectiveness estimates \textendash{} the added benefit of marine protection over and above conventional fisheries management \textendash{} to a gap analysis of existing MPAs, and MPAs proposed by four indigenous groups on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. Additionally, we assessed representation, size, spacing, and governance considerations against MPA design criteria outlined in the literature. We found significant differences in response ratios for IUCN Categories IV and VI MPAs compared to no-take reserves and areas open to fishing, although variability in responses was high. By rescaling the predicted ecological effectiveness ratios (including confidence estimates), we found that, compared to no-take reserves (biodiversity conservation effectiveness 100\%) and open fishing areas (0\% additional biodiversity contribution over and above conventional fisheries management), IUCN Category IV had a predicted effectiveness score of 60\%, ranging between 34\% and 89\% (95\% lower and upper confidence intervals, respectively), and IUCN Category VI had a predicted effectiveness score of 24\% (ranging between \`A12\% and 72\% for the 95\% lower and upper confidence intervals, respectively). We found that the existing MPAs did poorly when compared against most MPA design criteria, whereas the proposed MPA network achieved many of the best practices identified in the literature, and could achieve all if some additional sites were added. By using the Central Coast of British Columbia as a case study, we demonstrated a method for applying empirically-based ecological effectiveness estimates to an assessment of MPA design principles for an existing and proposed network of MPAs.},

Promoting best practice in benchmarking is its main goal. The article discusses eight essential topics in benchmarking: clearly stated goals, wellspecified problems, suitable algorithms, adequate performance measures, thoughtful analysis, effective and efficient designs, comprehensible presentations, and guaranteed reproducibility. The final goal is to provide well-accepted guidelines (rules) that might be useful for authors and reviewers.

  abstract = {Motivated by the need to solve ecological problems (climate change, habitat fragmentation and biological invasions), there has been increasing interest in species distribution models (SDMs). Predictions from these models inform conservation policy, invasive species management and disease-control measures. However, predictions are subject to uncertainty, the degree and source of which is often unrecognized. Here, we review the SDM literature in the context of uncertainty, focusing on three main classes of SDM: niche-based models, demographic models and process-based models. We identify sources of uncertainty for each class and discuss how uncertainty can be minimized or included in the modelling process to give realistic measures of confidence around predictions. Because this has typically not been performed, we conclude that uncertainty in SDMs has often been underestimated and a false precision assigned to predictions of geographical distribution. We identify areas where development of new statistical tools will improve predictions from distribution models, notably the development of hierarchical models that link different types of distribution model and their attendant uncertainties across spatial scales. Finally, we discuss the need to develop more defensible methods for assessing predictive performance, quantifying model goodness-of-fit and for assessing the significance of model covariates.},

The design of regional networks of marine reserves is concerned with the problem of where to place the marine protected areas and how to spatially configure them. Quantitative methods for doing this provide important decision support tools for marine managers. The central problem is to balance the costs and benefits of the reserve network, whilst satisfying conservation objectives (hence solving a constrained optimization problem). Current optimization algorithms for reserve design are widely used, but none allow for the systematic incorporation of data uncertainty and its effect on the reserve design solutions. The central purpose of this study is to provide a framework for incorporating uncertain ecological input data into algorithms for designing networks of marine reserves.},

For example, experimental results show that survey propagation (a certain message passing algorithm) is effective in finding proper k-colorings of random graphs in the near-threshold regime. In 1962 Gallager introduced the concept of Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes, and suggested a simple decoding algorithm based on message passing. In 1994 Alon and Kahale exhibited a coloring algorithm and proved its usefulness for finding a k-coloring of graphs drawn from a certain planted-solution distribution over kcolorable graphs. In this work we show an interpretation of Alon and Kahale's coloring algorithm in light of Gallager's decoding algorithm, thus showing a connection between the two problems - coloring and decoding. This also provides a rigorous evidence for the usefulness of the message passing paradigm for the graph coloring problem. Our techniques can be applied to several other combinatorial optimization problems and networking-related issues.},

This classic problem has already been considered in the literature of conservation biology. The originality of this article is to consider that the values of the survival probabilities of each species in each potential site may be subject to a certain error while assuming that the number of sites where these probabilities are wrong is limited. We thus define a set of possible survival probability values in each site. We then show how to determine, by solving a relatively simple mixed-integer linear program, an optimal robust reserve, i.e., a reserve which ensures that each species has a certain survival probability whatever the values taken by the survival probabilities in each site, in the set of possible values. The fact of being able to formulate the search for an optimal robust reserve by a mixed-integer linear program provides an easy way to take into account additional constraints on the selection of sites such as, for example, spatial constraints. We report some computational experiments carried out on many hypothetical landscapes to illustrate the concept of robust reserve and show the effectiveness of the approach.},

To protect the reserve of external disturbances, we also impose a connectivity constraint for the area outside the reserve.

  abstract = {In this article, we are concerned with the general problem of choosing from a set of taxa T a subset S to protect in order to try to contribute to halting biodiversity loss as efficiently as possible given limited resources. The protection of a taxon decreases its extinction probability, and the impact of protecting the taxa of S is measured by the resulting expected phylogenetic diversity (ePD) of the set T. The primary challenge posed by this approach lies in determining the extinction probability of a taxon (protected or unprotected). To deal with this difficulty, the uncertainty about the extinction probabilities can be described through a set of possible scenarios, each corresponding to different extinction probability values for each taxon. We show how to determine an Boptimal robust set\^ of taxa to protect, defined as the set of taxa that minimizes the maximum Bregret,\^ i.e., the maximum relative gap, over all the scenarios, between (1) the ePD of T obtained by protecting the taxa of this set and (2) the ePD of T which would be produced by protecting the subset of taxa optimal for the considered scenario. In our experimental conditions covering 100 cases, this gap is almost always less than 1\%. Consequently, the ePD of T obtained by protecting the taxa of the optimal robust set is not far from the maximum ePD of T that could have been obtained if we had known the true scenario. In other words, a way of escaping (in large part, at least) from the uncertainty related to the extinction probabilities of the taxa consists of choosing to protect those belonging to the optimal robust set. We also compare the optimal robust set to other relevant subsets of T.},

We show in this note that the choice of the precise values attributed to the extinction probabilities\textemdash provided it respects the rank of imperilment of each species\textemdash is not as decisive as might be feared for the considered problem. The values of these probabilities have a clear impact on the selection of the species to be protected but a little impact on the resulting ePD. More precisely, if T1 and T2 are the two optimal subsets of species corresponding to two scenarios (two different sets of probabilities) the ePDs of T1 and T2, calculated with the probabilities of the first scenario\textemdash or with the probabilities of the second scenario\textemdash are not very different.},

In this article, we are interested in the first issue. We present here many examples of the help that using mathematical programming can provide to decision-makers in the protection of biodiversity. The examples we have chosen concern the selection of nature reserves, the control of adverse effects caused by landscape fragmentation, including the creation or restoration of biological corridors, the ecological exploitation of forests, the control of invasive species, and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Most of the presented models are \textendash{} or can be approximated with \textendash{} linear-, quadratic- or fractional-integer formulations and emphasize spatial aspects of conservation planning. Many of them represent decisions taken in a static context but temporal dimension is also considered. The problems presented are generally difficult combinatorial optimization problems, some are well solved and others less well. Research is still needed to progress in solving them in order to deal with real instances satisfactorily. Moreover, relations between researchers and practitioners have to be strengthened. Furthermore, many recent achievements in the field of robust optimization could probably be successfully used for biodiversity protection, a domain in which many data are uncertain.},

The PD of a group of species X included in S is easy to calculate when the phylogenetic tree associated with S is perfectly known but this situation is rarely verified. We are interested here in cases where uncertainty regarding the length of branches and the topology of the tree is reflected in the fact that several phylogenetic trees are considered to be plausible for the set S. We propose several measures of the phylogenetic diversity to take account of the uncertainty arising from this situation. A natural problem in the field of biological conservation is to select the best subset of species to protect from a group of threatened species. Here, the best subset is the one that optimizes the proposed measures. We show how to solve these optimal selection problems by integer linear programming.

  abstract = {The Reserve Selection Problem consists in selecting certain sites among a set of potential sites for biodiversity protection. In many models of the literature, the species present and able to survive in each site are supposed to be known. Here, for every potential site and for every species considered, only the probability that the species survives in the site is supposed to be known. The problem to select, under a budgetary constraint, a set of sites which maximizes the expected number of species is known in the literature under the name of probabilistic reserve selection problem. In this article, this problem is studied with species weighting to deal differently with common species and rare species. A spatial constraint is also considered preventing to obtain too fragmented reserve networks. As in Polasky et al. (2000), the problem is formulated by a nonlinear mathematical program in Boolean variables. Camm et al. (2002) developed a mixed-integer linear programming approximation that may be solved with standard integer programming software. The method gives tight approximate solutions but does not allow to tell how far these solutions are from the optimum. In this paper, a slightly different approach is proposed to approximate the problem. The interesting aspect of the approach, which also uses only standard mixed-integer programming software, is that it leads, not only to an approximate solution, but also to an upper limit on the true optimal value. In other words, the method gives an approximate solution with a guarantee on its accuracy. The linear reformulation is based on an upper approximation of the logarithmic function by a piecewise-linear function. The approach is very effective on artificial instances that include up to 400 sites and 300 species. Within an average CPU time of about 12 min, near-optimal solutions are obtained with an average relative error, in comparison to the optimum, of less than 0.2\%.},

This situation makes it difficult to share and compare different approaches effectively, as is done in other, more established fields. It also unnecessarily hinders new researchers who want to work in this area. To address this problem, we introduce a standardized format for representing algorithm selection scenarios and a repository that contains a growing number of data sets from the literature. Our format has been designed to be able to express a wide variety of different scenarios.

  abstract = {The structure of ecological interaction networks is often interpreted as a product of meaningful ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that shape the degree of specialization in community associations. However, here we show that both unweighted network metrics (connectance, nestedness, and degree distribution) and weighted network metrics (interaction evenness, interaction strength asymmetry) are strongly constrained and biased by the number of observations. Rarely observed species are inevitably regarded as ``specialists,'' irrespective of their actual associations, leading to biased estimates of specialization. Consequently, a skewed distribution of species observation records (such as the lognormal), combined with a relatively low sampling density typical for ecological data, already generates a ``nested'' and poorly ``connected'' network with ``asymmetric interaction strengths'' when interactions are neutral. This is confirmed by null model simulations of bipartite networks, assuming that partners associate randomly in the absence of any specialization and any variation in the correspondence of biological traits between associated species (trait matching). Variation in the skewness of the frequency distribution fundamentally changes the outcome of network metrics. Therefore, interpretation of network metrics in terms of fundamental specialization and trait matching requires an appropriate control for such severe constraints imposed by information deficits. When using an alternative approach that controls for these effects, most natural networks of mutualistic or antagonistic systems show a significantly higher degree of reciprocal specialization (exclusiveness) than expected under neutral conditions. A higher exclusiveness is coherent with a tighter coevolution and suggests a lower ecological redundancy than implied by nested networks.},

We investigate to what extent the Matthew effect drives the allocation of research funds. To this end, we assembled a dataset containing all review scores and funding decisions of grant proposals submitted by recent PhDs in a \texteuro 2 billion granting program. Analyses of review scores reveal that early funding success introduces a growing rift, with winners just above the funding threshold accumulating more than twice as much research funding (\texteuro 180,000) during the following eight years as nonwinners just below it. We find no evidence that winners' improved funding chances in subsequent competitions are due to achievements enabled by the preceding grant, which suggests that early funding itself is an asset for acquiring later funding. Surprisingly, however, the emergent funding gap is partly created by applicants, who, after failing to win one grant, apply for another grant less often.},

The stock market is the archetypal example, which in most developed economies captures a lot of attention and resources. Is the stock market just a sideshow or does it affect real economic activity? In this review, we discuss the potential real effects of financial markets that stem from the informational role of market prices. We review the theoretical literature and show that accounting for the feedback effect from market prices to the real economy significantly changes our understanding of the price formation process, the informativeness of the price, and speculators' trading behavior. We make two main points. First, we argue that a new definition of price efficiency is needed to account for the extent to which prices reflect information that is useful for the efficiency of real decisions (rather than the extent to which they forecast future cash flows). Second, incorporating the feedback effect into models of financial markets can explain various market phenomena that otherwise seem puzzling. Finally, we review empirical evidence on the real effects of secondary financial markets.},

For both of these goals, there is a need for general principles on which to base marine reserve design, and because of the paucity of empirical experience, these principles must be based on models. However, most of the theoretical studies to date have been specific to a single situation, with few attempts to deduce general principles. Here we attempt to distill existing results into general principles useful to designers of marine reserves. To answer the question of how fishery management using reserves compares to conventional management, we provide two principles: (1) the effect of reserves on yield per recruit is similar to increasing the age of first capture, and (2) the effect of reserves on yield is similar to reducing effort. Another two principles answer the question of how to design reserve configurations so that species with movement in various stages will be sustainable: (3) higher juvenile and adult movement lowers sustainability of reserves for biodiversity, but an intermediate level of adult movement is required for reserves for fishery management, and (4) longer larval dispersal distance requires larger reserves for sustainability. These principles provide general guidelines for design, and attention to them will allow more rapid progress in future modeling studies. Whether populations or communities will persist under any specific reserve design is uncertain, and we suggest ways of dealing with that uncertainty.},

My results indicate a positive relationship between the number of SDM related articles published in a journal and its impact factor (IF) growth during the period 2000\textendash 09. However, the percentage of SDM related papers in a journal was strongly and positively associated with the percentage of papers on climate change and statistical issues. The results support the hypothesis that global change science has been critical in the development of SDMs and that interest in climate change research in particular, rather than the usage of SDM per se, appears as an important factor behind journal IF increases in ecology and environmental sciences. Finally, our results on SDM application in global change science support the view that scientific interest rather than methodological fashion appears to be the major driver of research attraction in the scientific literature.},

  abstract = {Site-selection algorithms are used in reserve design to select networks of sites that maximize biodiversity, given some constraints. These algorithms are based on a snapshot of species occurrence, and they typically aim to minimize the area or cost needed to represent all the species once or a few times. Most of these algorithms ignore the question of how well species are likely to persist in the set of selected sites in the long term. Furthermore, the role of the unselected habitat in biodiversity persistence has received no attention in this context. We used a theoretical approach to evaluate the long-term performance of reserve networks in preserving biodiversity by using a model of spatiotemporal population dynamics (a metapopulation model). We compared extinction rates of species in reserve networks in two situations: when all sites remain suitable habitat for the species and, conversely, when the habitat in the unselected sites is lost. We made this comparison to explore the significance of unselected sites for spatial population dynamics and for the continued presence of species in the reserve network. Basic site-selection algorithms are liable to perform badly in terms of biodiversity maintenance because the persistence of species may be strongly dependent on sites not included in the reserve network. Our results support recent calls for the integration of spatial population modeling into reserve network design. Advances in metapopulation theory provide tools that can be used for this purpose.},

Local search has proved successful for this problem. However, there are two main drawbacks in state-of-the-art MVC local search algorithms. First, they select a pair of vertices to exchange simultaneously, which is timeconsuming. Secondly, although using edge weighting techniques to diversify the search, these algorithms lack mechanisms for decreasing the weights. To address these issues, we propose two new strategies: two-stage exchange and edge weighting with forgetting. The two-stage exchange strategy selects two vertices to exchange separately and performs the exchange in two stages. The strategy of edge weighting with forgetting not only increases weights of uncovered edges, but also decreases some weights for each edge periodically. These two strategies are used in designing a new MVC local search algorithm, which is referred to as NuMVC.},

  abstract = {A Virtual Best Solver (VBS) is a hypothetical algorithm that selects the best solver from a given portfolio of alternatives on a per-instance basis. The VBS idealizes performance when all solvers in a portfolio are run in parallel, and also gives a valuable bound on the performance of portfolio-based algorithm selectors. Typically, VBS performance is measured by running every solver in a portfolio once on a given instance and reporting the best performance over all solvers. Here, we argue that doing so results in a flawed measure that is biased to reporting better performance when a randomized solver is present in an algorithm portfolio. Specifically, this flawed notion of VBS tends to show performance better than that achievable by a perfect selector that for each given instance runs the solver with the best expected running time. We report results from an empirical study using solvers and instances submitted to several SAT competitions, in which we observe significant bias on many random instances and some combinatorial instances. We also show that the bias increases with the number of randomized solvers and decreases as we average solver performance over many independent runs per instance. We propose an alternative VBS performance measure by (1) empirically obtaining the solver with best expected performance for each instance and (2) taking bootstrap samples for this solver on every instance, to obtain a confidence interval on VBS performance. Our findings shed new light on widely studied algorithm selection benchmarks and help explain performance gaps observed between VBS and state-of-the-art algorithm selection approaches.},

In this work we present a methodology for defining the required sample sizes for designing experiments with desired statistical properties for the comparison of two methods on a given problem class. The proposed approach allows the experimenter to define desired levels of accuracy for estimates of mean performance differences on individual problem instances, as well as the desired statistical power for comparing mean performances over a problem class of interest. The method calculates the required number of problem instances, and runs the algorithms on each test instance so that the accuracy of the estimated differences in performance is controlled at the predefined level. Two examples illustrate the application of the proposed method, and its ability to achieve the desired statistical properties with a methodologically sound definition of the relevant sample sizes.},

Besides being the basis for efficient parameterized algorithms, this method also provides a wealth of information to reason about in the context of constraint programming. We study the use of kernelization for designing propagators through the example of the Vertex Cover constraint. Since the classic kernelization rules often correspond to dominance rather than consistency, we introduce the notion of ``loss-less'' kernel. While our preliminary experimental results show the potential of the approach, they also show some of its limits. In particular, this method is more effective for vertex covers of large and sparse graphs, as they tend to have, relatively, smaller kernels.},

  abstract = {The effectiveness of a system of reserves may be compromised under climate change as species' habitat shifts to nonreserved areas, a problem that may be compounded when well-studied vertebrate species are used as conservation umbrellas for other taxa. The Northwest Forest Plan was among the first efforts to integrate conservation of wideranging focal species and localized endemics into regional conservation planning. We evaluated how effectively the plan's focal species, the Northern Spotted Owl, acts as an umbrella for localized species under current and projected future climates and how the regional system of reserves can be made more resilient to climate change. We used the program MAXENT to develop distribution models integrating climate data with vegetation variables for the owl and 130 localized species. We used the program ZONATION to identify a system of areas that efficiently captures habitat for both the owl and localized species and prioritizes refugial areas of climatic and topographic heterogeneity where current and future habitat for dispersal-limited species is in proximity. We projected future species' distributions based on an ensemble of contrasting climate models, and incorporating uncertainty between alternate climate projections into the prioritization process. Reserve solutions based on the owl overlap areas of high localized-species richness but poorly capture core areas of localized species' distribution. Congruence between priority areas across taxa increases when refugial areas are prioritized. Although corearea selection strategies can potentially increase the conservation value and resilience of regional reserve systems, they accentuate contrasts in priority areas between species and over time and should be combined with a broadened taxonomic scope and increased attention to potential effects of climate change. Our results suggest that systems of fixed reserves designed for resilience can increase the likelihood of retaining the biological diversity of forest ecosystems under climate change.},

It does this by learning multiple tasks in parallel using a shared representation. Multitask transfer in connectionist nets has already been proven. But questions remain about how often training data for useful extra tasks will be available, and if multitask transfer will work in other learning methods. This paper argues that many real world problems present opportunities for multitask learning if they are not rst overly sanitized. We present eight prototypical applications of multitask transfer where the training signals for related tasks are available and can be leveraged. We also outline algorithms for multitask transfer in decision trees and k-nearest neighbor. We conclude that multitask transfer has broad utility.},

Experiments show that Logistic Correction and boosting with log-loss work well when boosting weak models such as decision stumps, but yield poor performance when boosting more complex models such as full decision trees. Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression, however, significantly improve the probabilities predicted by both boosted stumps and boosted trees. After calibration, boosted full decision trees predict better probabilities than other learning methods such as SVMs, neural nets, bagged decision trees, and KNNs, even after these methods are calibrated.},

Excess capacity allows better fit to regions of high non-linearity, and backprop often avoids overfitting the regions of low non-linearity. 2) Regardless of size, nets learn task subcomponents in similar sequence. Big nets pass through stages similar to those learned by smaller nets. Early stopping can stop training the large net when it generalizes comparably to a smaller net. We also show that conjugate gradient can yield worse generalization because it overfits regions of low non-linearity when learning to fit regions of high non-linearity.},

There are several important sources of uncertainty intrinsic to using species occurrence projections for reserve system design including uncertainty in the number of occurrences captured by any reserve selection solution, and uncertainty arising from the different approaches used to fit predictive models. Here we used the present and future predicted distributions of Iberian herptiles to analyze how dynamics and uncertainty in species distributions may affect decisions about resource allocation for conservation in space and time. We identified priority areas maximizing coverage of current and future (2020 and 2080) predicted distributions of 65 species, under ``Mild'' and ``Severe'' uncertainty. Next, we applied a return-on-investment analysis to quantify and make explicit trade-offs between investing in areas selected when optimizing for different times and with different uncertainty levels. Areas identified as important for conservation in every time frame and uncertainty level were the ones considered to be robust climate adaptation investments, and included chiefly already protected areas. Areas identified only under ``Mild'' uncertainty were considered good candidates for investment if extra resources are available and were mainly located in northern Iberia. However, areas selected only in the ``Severe'' uncertainty case should not be completely disregarded as they may become climatic refugia for some species. Our study provides an objective methodology to deliver ``no regrets'' conservation investments.},

  abstract = {Spatially explicit information on the financial costs of conservation actions can improve the ability of conservation planning to achieve ecological and economic objectives, but the magnitude of this improvement may depend on the accuracy of the cost estimates. Data on costs of conservation actions are inherently uncertain. For example, the cost of purchasing a property for addition to a protected-area network depends on the individual landholder's preferences, values, and aspirations, all of which vary in space and time, and the effect of this uncertainty on the conservation priority of a site is relatively untested. We investigated the sensitivity of the conservation priority of sites to uncertainty in cost estimates. We explored scenarios for expanding (four-fold) the protected-area network in Queensland, Australia to represent a range of vegetation types, species, and abiotic environments, while minimizing the cost of purchasing new properties. We estimated property costs for 17, 790 10 \texttimes{} 10 km sites with data on unimproved land values. We systematically changed property costs and noted how these changes affected conservation priority of a site. The sensitivity of the priority of a site to changes in cost data was largely dependent on a site's importance for meeting conservation targets. Sites that were essential or unimportant for meeting targets maintained high or low priorities, respectively, regardless of cost estimates. Sites of intermediate conservation priority were sensitive to property costs and represented the best option for efficiency gains, especially if they could be purchased at a lower price than anticipated. Thus, uncertainty in cost estimates did not impede the use of cost data in conservation planning, and information on the sensitivity of the conservation priority of a site to estimates of the price of land can be used to inform strategic conservation planning before the actual price of the land is known.},

  abstract = {We consider two closely related problems: planted clustering and submatrix localization. In the planted clustering problem, a random graph is generated based on an underlying cluster structure of the nodes; the task is to recover these clusters given the graph. The submatrix localization problem concerns locating hidden submatrices with elevated means inside a large real-valued random matrix. Of particular interest is the setting where the number of clusters/submatrices is allowed to grow unbounded with the problem size. These formulations cover several classical models such as planted clique, planted densest subgraph, planted partition, planted coloring, and the stochastic block model, which are widely used for studying community detection, graph clustering and bi-clustering.},

  abstract = {In statistics, the Durbin-Watson test is always employed to detect the presence of serial correlation of residuals from a least squares regression analysis. However, the Durbin-Watson statistic is only suitable for ordered time or spatial series. If the variables comprise cross-sectional data coming from spatial random sampling, the Durbin-Watson will be ineffectual because the value of Durbin-Watson's statistic depends on the sequences of data point arrangement. Based on the ideas from spatial autocorrelation, this paper presents two new statistics for testing serial correlation of residuals from least squares regression based on spatial samples. By analogy with the new form of Moran's index, an autocorrelation coefficient is defined with a standardized residual vector and a normalized spatial weight matrix. Then on the analogy of the Durbin-Watson statistic, a serial correlation index is constructed. As a case, the two statistics are applied to the spatial sample of 29 China's regions. These results show that the new spatial autocorrelation model can be used to test the serial correlation of residuals from regression analysis. In practice, the new statistics can make up for the deficiency of the Durbin-Watson test.},

  abstract = {Spatial data characteristics have the potential to influence various aspects of prioritising biodiversity areas for systematic conservation planning. There has been some exploration of the combined effects of size of planning units and level of classification of physical environments on the pattern and extent of priority areas. However, these data characteristics have yet to be explicitly investigated in terms of their interaction with different socioeconomic cost data during the spatial prioritisation process. We quantify the individual and interacting effects of three factors\textemdash planning-unit size, thematic resolution of reef classes, and spatial variability of socioeconomic costs\textemdash on spatial priorities for marine conservation, in typical marine planning exercises that use reef classification maps as a proxy for biodiversity. We assess these factors by creating 20 unique prioritisation scenarios involving combinations of different levels of each factor. Because output data from these scenarios are analogous to ecological data, we applied ecological statistics to determine spatial similarities between reserve designs. All three factors influenced prioritisations to different extents, with cost variability having the largest influence, followed by planning-unit size and thematic resolution of reef classes. The effect of thematic resolution on spatial design depended on the variability of cost data used. In terms of incidental representation of conservation objectives derived from finer-resolution data, scenarios prioritised with uniform cost outperformed those prioritised with variable cost. Following our analyses, we make recommendations to help maximise the spatial and cost efficiency and potential effectiveness of future marine conservation plans in similar planning scenarios. We recommend that planners: employ the smallest planning-unit size practical; invest in data at the highest possible resolution; and, when planning across regional extents with the intention of incidentally representing fine-resolution features, prioritise the whole region with uniform costs rather than using coarse-resolution data on variable costs.},

  abstract = {Finding a satisfying assignment for a k-CNF formula (k {$\geq$} 3), assuming such exists, is a notoriously hard problem. In this work we consider the uniform distribution over satisfiable k-CNF formulas with a linear number of clauses (clause-variable ratio greater than some constant). We rigorously analyze the structure of the space of satisfying assignments of a random formula in that distribution, showing that basically all satisfying assignments are clustered in one cluster, and agree on all but a small, though linear, number of variables. This observation enables us to describe a polynomial time algorithm that finds whp a satisfying assignment for such formulas, thus asserting that most satisfiable k-CNF formulas are easy (whenever the clause-variable ratio is greater than some constant). This should be contrasted with the setting of very sparse k-CNF formulas (which are satisfiable whp), where experimental results show some regime of clause density to be difficult for many SAT heuristics. One explanation for this phenomena, backed up by partially non-rigorous analytical tools from statistical physics, is the complicated clustering of the solution space at that regime, unlike the more ``regular'' structure that denser formulas possess. Thus in some sense, our result rigorously supports this explanation.},

  abstract = {A capacity for the animal to recover quickly from the impact of physical and social stressors and disease challenges is likely to improve evolutionary fitness of wild species and welfare and performance of farm animals. Salience and valence of stimuli sensed through neurosensors, chemosensors and immunosensors are perceived and integrated centrally to generate emotions and engage physiological, behavioural, immune, cognitive and morphological responses that defend against noxious challenges. These responses can be refined through experience to provide anticipatory and learned reactions at lower cost than innate less-specific reactions. Influences of behaviour type, coping style, and affective state and the relationships between immune responsiveness, disease resistance and resilience are reviewed. We define resilience as the capacity of animals to cope with short-term perturbations in their environment and return rapidly to their pre-challenge status. It is manifested in response to episodic, sporadic or situation-specific attributes of the environment and can be optimised via facultative learning by the individual. It is a comparative measure of differences between individuals in the outcomes that follow exposure to potentially adverse situations. In contrast, robustness is the capacity to maintain productivity in a wide range of environments without compromising reproduction, health and wellbeing. Robustness is manifested in response to persistent or cyclical attributes of the environment and is effected via activity of innate regulatory pathways. We suggest that for farm animals, husbandry practices that incorporate physical and social stressors and interactions with humans such as weaning, change of housing, and introduction to the milking parlour can be used to characterise resilience phenotypes. In these settings, resilience is likely to be more readily identified through the rate of return of variables to pre-challenge or normal status rather than through measuring the activity of diverse stress response and adaptation mechanisms. Our strategy for phenotyping resilience of sheep and cattle during weaning is described. Opportunities are examined to increase resilience through genetic selection and through improved management practices that provide emotional and cognitive enrichment and stress inoculation.},

  abstract = {Algorithms are now regularly used to decide whether defendants awaiting trial are too dangerous to be released back into the community. In some cases, black defendants are substantially more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly classi ed as high risk. To mitigate such disparities, several techniques have recently been proposed to achieve algorithmic fairness. Here we reformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained optimization: the objective is to maximize public safety while satisfying formal fairness constraints designed to reduce racial disparities. We show that for several past de nitions of fairness, the optimal algorithms that result require detaining defendants above race-speci c risk thresholds. We further show that the optimal unconstrained algorithm requires applying a single, uniform threshold to all defendants. e unconstrained algorithm thus maximizes public safety while also satisfying one important understanding of equality: that all individuals are held to the same standard, irrespective of race. Because the optimal constrained and unconstrained algorithms generally di er, there is tension between improving public safety and satisfying prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness. By examining data from Broward County, Florida, we show that this trade-o can be large in practice. We focus on algorithms for pretrial release decisions, but the principles we discuss apply to other domains, and also to human decision makers carrying out structured decision rules.},

In this paper, the focus is on gaining insight in the behaviour of a heuristic algorithm by investigating how the various elements operating within the algorithm correlate with performance, obtaining indications of which combinations work well and which do not, and how all these effects are influenced by the specific problem instance the algorithm is solving. We consider two approaches for analysing algorithm parameters and components \textemdash{} functional analysis of variance and multilevel regression analysis \textemdash{} and study the benefits of using both approaches jointly. We present the results of a combined methodology that is able to provide more insights than when the two approaches are used separately.

  abstract = {Marine managers routinely use spatial data to make decisions about their marine environment. Uncertainty associated with this spatial data can have profound impacts on these management decisions and their projected outcomes. Recent advances in modeling techniques, including species distribution models (SDMs), make it easier to generate continuous maps showing the uncertainty associated with spatial predictions and maps. However, SDM predictions and maps can be complex and nuanced. This complexity makes their use challenging for non-technical managers, preventing them from having the best available information to make decisions. To help bridge these communication and information gaps, we developed maps to illustrate how SDMs and associated uncertainty can be translated into readily usable products for managers. We also explicitly described the potential impacts of uncertainty on marine zoning decisions. This approach was applied to a case study in Saipan Lagoon, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Managers in Saipan are interested in minimizing the potential impacts of personal watercraft (e.g., jet skis) on staghorn Acropora (i.e., Acropora aspera, A. formosa, and A. pulchra), which is an important coral assemblage in the lagoon. We used a recently completed SDM for staghorn Acropora to develop maps showing the sensitivity of zoning options to three different prediction and three different uncertainty thresholds (nine combinations total). Our analysis showed that the amount of area and geographic location of predicted staghorn Acropora presence changed based on these nine combinations. These dramatically different spatial patterns would have significant zoning implications when considering where to exclude and/or allow jet skis operations inside the lagoon. They also show that different uncertainty thresholds may lead managers to markedly different conclusions and courses of action. Defining acceptable levels of uncertainty upfront is critical for ensuring that managers can make more informed decisions, meet their marine resource goals and generate favorable outcomes for their stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Expert-based and systematic, algorithm-based approaches to identifying priority areas for conservation are sometimes posited as alternatives. While both approaches have pros and cons, the systematic approach does have the advantage of providing a regionwide assessment of the options for achieving explicit conservation targets. A distinct advantage of the expert-driven approach is its incorporation of expert knowledge on biodiversity persistence and pragmatic management and implementation issues not normally included in biodiversity feature-site data matrices. Given the widespread application of both approaches, surprisingly little research has been undertaken to evaluate their conservation planning outcomes. Here we compare priority conservation areas in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region identified by park managers and reserve-selection software. Managers identified 29 areas (a wishlist) that together, comprised 31\% of the planning domain and had 40\% of its area under some form of conservation management. This wishlist was assessed for the extent to which it achieved targets for biodiversity pattern and process over and above the existing conservation system, and its incorporation of priority areas identified in terms of conservation value and vulnerability to processes that threaten biodiversity. Overall, the wishlist reflected a desire by managers to improve management efficiency and facilitate rapid implementation by expanding existing, largely montane reserves into low-priority areas where land tenure is sympathetic to conservation. Consequently, it was not very effective and efficient in achieving pattern and process targets, and it excluded large areas of vulnerable and inadequately conserved lowland habitat\textemdash the areas currently in most need of conservation action. Further, it provided no basis for scheduling implementation or for exploring alternative areas to achieve the same goals, unlike systematic approaches. Nonetheless, the manager's wishlist did include many highly innovative and feasible projects that make important contributions to the conservation of the region's biodiversity. Rather than emphasize the dichotomy between expert and systematic approaches, conservation planners should devise ways of integrating them. In particular, priority areas identified by experts should be carefully considered against the backdrop of the outcomes of systematic conservation planning.},

Precisely, we investigate the expected runtime required by a global evolutionary optimization algorithm with an ergodic variation operator (GSEMO) and by a neighborhood-based local search heuristic (PLS), to identify a (1 + {$\epsilon$})-approximation of the Pareto set. Then, we define a number of problem features characterizing the fitness landscape, and we study their intercorrelation and their association with algorithm runtime on the benchmark instances. At last, with a mixed-effects multilinear regression we assess the individual and joint effect of problem features on the performance of both algorithms, within and across the instance classes defined by benchmark parameters. Our analysis reveals further insights into the importance of ruggedness and multimodality to characterize instance hardness for this family of multiobjective optimization problems and algorithms.},

Several developments have been reported on various aspects of the algorithm in these 5 years and the research on and with DE have now reached an impressive state. Considering the huge progress of research with DE and its applications in diverse domains of science and technology, we find that it is a high time to provide a critical review of the latest literatures published and also to point out some important future avenues of research. The purpose of this paper is to summarize and organize the information on these current developments on DE. Beginning with a comprehensive foundation of the basic DE family of algorithms, we proceed through the recent proposals on parameter adaptation of DE, DE-based single-objective global optimizers, DE adopted for various optimization scenarios including constrained, large-scale, multi-objective, multi-modal and dynamic optimization, hybridization of DE with other optimizers, and also the multifaceted literature on applications of DE. The paper also presents a dozen of interesting open problems and future research issues on DE.},

  abstract = {The embedded ensemble propagation approach introduced in [49] has been demonstrated to be a powerful means of reducing the computational cost of sampling-based uncertainty quantification methods, particularly on emerging computational architectures. A substantial challenge with this method however is ensemble-divergence, whereby different samples within an ensemble choose different code paths. This can reduce the effectiveness of the method and increase computational cost. Therefore grouping samples together to minimize this divergence is paramount in making the method effective for challenging computational simulations. In this work, a new grouping approach based on a surrogate for computational cost built up during the uncertainty propagation is developed and applied to model diffusion problems where computational cost is driven by the number of (preconditioned) linear solver iterations. The approach is developed within the context of locally adaptive stochastic collocation methods, where a surrogate for the number of linear solver iterations, generated from previous levels of the adaptive grid generation, is used to predict iterations for subsequent samples, and group them based on similar numbers of iterations. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by applying it to highly anisotropic diffusion problems with a wide variation in solver iterations from sample to sample. It extends the parameter-based grouping approach developed in [17] to more general problems without requiring detailed knowledge of how the uncertain parameters affect the simulation's cost, and is also less intrusive to the simulation code.},

  abstract = {With ongoing global change, there is an urgent need to expand existing networks of important conservation areas around the world. In the western United States, vast areas of public land, including those administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), present substantial conservation opportunities. For 11 contiguous western states, we used a novel multiple-criteria analysis to model and map contiguous areas of roadless BLM land that possessed important ecological indicators of high biodiversity, resilience to climate change, and landscape connectivity. Specifically, we leveraged available spatial datasets to implement a systematic and statistically robust analysis of seven key indicators at three different spatial scales, and to identify the locations of potential conservation priority areas (CPAs) across 294,274 km2 of roadless BLM land. Within this extent, and based on conservative thresholds in our results, we identified 43,417 km2 of land with relatively high conservation value and 117 unique CPAs totaling 6291 km2. Most CPA lands were located in Utah, Colorado, Arizona, Oregon, and Nevada. Overall, CPAs had higher species richness, vegetation community diversity, topographic complexity, and surface water availability than existing BLM protected areas. CPAs often corresponded with locations known to have important wilderness characteristics or were adjacent to established areas of ecological, social, or cultural importance. These CPAs represent a diverse set of places that can be used by multiple stakeholders in ongoing or future landscape conservation and special designation efforts in BLM and adjacent ownerships. Our methodological framework and novel weighting approach can accommodate a wide range of input variables and is readily applicable to other jurisdictions and regions within the U.S. and beyond. \'O 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As a consequence, tens of indices are available to address similar questions, differing in specific detail, sensitivity in detecting the property in question, and robustness with respect to network size and sampling intensity. Furthermore, some indices merely reflect the number of species participating in a network, but not their interrelationship, requiring a null model approach. Here we introduce a new, free software calculating a large spectrum of network indices, visualizing bipartite networks and generating null models. We use this tool to explore the sensitivity of 26 network indices to network dimensions, sampling intensity and singleton observations. Based on observed data, we investigate the interrelationship of these indices, and show that they are highly correlated, and heavily influenced by network dimensions and connectance. Finally, we re-evaluate five common hypotheses about network properties, comparing 19 pollination networks with three differently complex null models: 1. The number of links per species (``degree'') follow (truncated) power law distributions. 2. Generalist pollinators interact with specialist plants, and vice versa (dependence asymmetry). 3. Ecological networks are nested. 4. Pollinators display complementarity, owing to specialization within the network. 5. Plant-pollinator networks are more robust to extinction than random networks. Our results indicate that while some hypotheses hold up against our null models, others are to a large extent understandable on the basis of network size, rather than ecological interrelationships. In particular, null model pattern of dependence asymmetry and robustness to extinction are opposite to what current network paradigms suggest. Our analysis, and the tools we provide, enables ecologists to readily contrast their findings with null model expectations for many different questions, thus separating statistical inevitability from ecological process.},

In this position paper, we first define interpretability and describe when interpretability is needed (and when it is not). Next, we suggest a taxonomy for rigorous evaluation and expose open questions towards a more rigorous science of interpretable machine learning.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Species distribution models (SDMs) have been proposed as a way to provide robust inference about species-specific sites suitabilities, and have been increasingly used in systematic conservation planning (SCP) applications. However, despite the fact that the use of SDMs in SCP may raise some potential issues, conservation studies have overlooked to assess the implications of SDMs uncertainties. The integration of these uncertainties in conservation solutions requires the development of a reserve-selection approach based on a suitable optimization algorithm. A large body of research has shown that exact optimization algorithms give very precise control over the gap to optimality of conservation solutions. However, their major shortcoming is that they generate a single binary and indivisible solution. Therefore, they provide no flexibility in the implementation of conservation solutions by stakeholders. On the other hand, heuristic decision-support systems provide large amounts of sub-optimal solutions, and therefore more flexibility. This flexibility arises from the availability of many alternative and sub-optimal conservation solutions. The two principles of efficiency and flexibility are implicitly linked in conservation applications, with the most mathematically efficient solutions being inflexible and the flexible solutions provided by heuristics suffering sub-optimality. In order to avoid the trade-offs between flexibility and efficiency in systematic conservation planning, we propose in this paper a new reserve-selection framework based on mathematical programming optimization combined with a post-selection of SDM outputs. This approach leads to a reserve-selection framework that might provide flexibility while simultaneously addressing efficiency and representativeness of conservation solutions and the adequacy of conservation targets. To exemplify the approach we a nalyzed an experimental design crossing pre- and post-selection of SDM outputs versus heuristics and exact mathematical optimizations. We used the Mediterranean Sea as a biogeographical template for our analyses, integrating the outputs of 8 SDM techniques for 438 fishes species.},

  abstract = {John Tsotsos asked his AI students to work on having an AI solve a jigsaw puzzle, though it is NP-complete. This paper considers the search time of the recursive backtracking algorithm for solving it when the puzzle pieces are generated randomly with a planted solution. Feeling that a jigsaw puzzle should have a particular image when completed, we set the probability that two pieces fit together locally to be just small enough that with high probability the planted solution is unique. We were surprised to see that in this case the recursive backtracking algorithm which expands a rectangle from a corner has expected 1 + \k{o} branching width. In contrast, this width is exponential if it attempts to put together just the edge pieces into a frame, build a triangle from a corner, or build a block in the middle. If the probability of pieces fitting together is increased just to the point that there is an exponential number of complete solutions, then no matter which order the pieces are put together it takes an exponential amount of time to find one of these exponentially many solutions. It is also interesting that for the different orders of completing the puzzle, there are very different ``reasons'' for the exponential blowup. We coded the algorithm and it ran just as described.},

We examined whether basic principles of graph theory can be extended to other ecosystems. Specifically, we demonstrate how a network-based context can be used for enhancing the more effective conservation of riverine systems. We first show how to use graph theoretic techniques to model riverscapes at the segment level. Then we use a real stream network (Zagyva river basin, Hungary) to examine the topological importance of segments in maintaining riverscape connectivity, using betweenness centrality, a commonly used network measure. Using the undirected graph model of this riverscape, we then prioritize segments for conservation purpose. We examine the value of each of the 93 segments present in the Zagyva river basin by considering the conservation value of local fish assemblages, connectivity and the size of the habitat patches. For this purpose we use the `integral index of connectivity', a recently advocated habitat availability index. Based on the results the selection of the most valuable habitat segments can be optimized depending on conservation resources. Because of their inherent advantage in the consideration of connectivity relationships, we suggest that network analyses offer a simple, yet effective tool for searching for key segments (or junctions) in riverscapes for conservation and environmental management. Further, although the joint consideration of aquatic and terrestrial networks is challenging, the extension of network analyses to freshwater systems may facilitate the more effective selection of priority areas for conservation in continental areas.},

Experiments over both the DIMACS benchmark and the BHOSLIB benchmark show that VEWLS outperforms NuMVC, the state-of-the-art local search algorithm for MVC, on 73\% and 68\% of the instances, respectively.},

  abstract = {Cellular frustrated models have been developed to describe how the adaptive immune system works. They are composed by independent agents that continuously pair and unpair depending on the information that one sub-set of these agents display. The emergent dynamics is sensitive to changes in the displayed information and can be used to detect anomalies, which can be important to accomplish the immune system main function of protecting the host. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that these models could be adequate to model the immune system activation. Likewise it has been hypothesized that these models could provide inspiration to develop new artificial intelligence algorithms for data mining applications. However, computational algorithms do not need to follow strictly the immunological reality. Here, we investigate efficient implementation strategies of these immune inspired ideas for anomaly detection applications and use real data to compare the performance of cellular frustration algorithms with standard implementations of one-class support vector machines and deep autoencoders. Our results demonstrate that more efficient implementations of cellular frustration algorithms are possible and also that cellular frustration algorithms can be advantageous for semi-supervised anomaly detection applications given their robustness and accuracy.},

  abstract = {The known NP-hardness results imply that for many combinatorial optimization problems there are no efficient algorithms that find an optimal solution, or even a near optimal solution, on every instance. A heuristic for an NP-hard problem is a polynomial time algorithm that produces optimal or near optimal solutions on some input instances, but may fail on others. The study of heuristics involves both an algorithmic issue (the design of the heuristic algorithm) and a conceptual challenge, namely, how does one evaluate the quality of a heuristic. Current methods for evaluating heuristics include experimental evidence, hand waving arguments, and rigorous analysis of the performance of the heuristic on some wide (in a sense that depends on the context) classes of inputs. This talk is concerned with the latter method. On the conceptual side, several frameworks that have been used in order to model the classes of inputs of interest (including random models, semi-random models, smoothed analysis) will be discussed. On the algorithmic side, several algorithmic techniques and principles of analysis that are often useful in these frameworks will be presented.},

Our algorithm achieves the best-known bounds for the number of edges needed for perfect recovery and its running time is linear in the number of edges used. The time complexity is significantly better than both spectral and SDP-based approaches. The main new features of the algorithm are two-fold: (i) the critical use of power iteration with subsampling, which might be of independent interest; its analysis requires keeping track of multiple norms of an evolving solution (ii) it can be implemented statistically, i.e., with very limited access to the input distribution.},

  abstract = {For a planted satisfiability problem on n variables with k variables per constraint, the planted assignment becomes the unique solution after O(n log n) random clauses. However, the bestknown algorithms need at least nr/2 to efficiently identify any assignment weakly correlated with the planted one for clause distributions that are (r - 1)-wise independent (r can be as high as k). Our main result is an unconditional lower bound, tight up to logarithmic factors, of {$\Omega$}\texttildelow{} (nr/2) clauses for statistical algorithms, a broad class of algorithms introduced in [50, 34]. We complement this with a nearly matching upper bound using a statistical algorithm. As known approaches for problems over distributions in general, and planted satisfiability problems in particular, all have statistical analogues (spectral, MCMC, gradient-based, convex optimization etc.), this provides a rigorous explanation of the large gap between the identifiability and algorithmic identifiability thresholds for random satisfiability problems with planted solutions. Our results imply that a strong form of Feige's refutation hypothesis for average-case SAT instances [31] holds for statistical algorithms. We also consider the closely related problem of finding the planted assignment of a random planted k-CSP which is the basis of Goldreich's proposed one-way function [41]. Our bounds extend to this problem and give concrete evidence for the security of the one-way function and the associated pseudorandom generator when used with a sufficiently hard predicate.},

Such attribution requires knowing what outcomes would have looked like in the absence of the intervention. This counterfactual world can be inferred only indirectly through evaluation designs that control for confounding factors. Some have argued that environmental policy is different from other social policy fields, and thus attempting to establish causality through identification of counterfactual outcomes is quixotic. This chapter argues that elucidating causal relationships through counterfactual thinking and experimental or quasi-experimental designs is absolutely critical in environmental policy, and that many opportunities for doing so exist. Without more widespread application of such approaches, little progress will be made on building the evidence base in environmental policy. \textcopyright{} Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  author = {Fischer, Douglas T and Church, Richard L},
  pages = {12},
  abstract = {Over the last 15 yr, a number of formal mathematical models and heuristics have been developed for the purpose of selecting sites for biodiversity conservation. One of these models, the Biodiversity Management Area Selection (BMAS) model (Church et al. 1996a), places a major emphasis on protecting at least a certain area for each biodiversity element. Viewed spatially, solutions from this model tend to be a combination of isolated planning units and, sometimes, small clusters. One method to identify solutions with potentially less fragmentation is to add an objective to minimize the outside perimeter of selected areas. Outside perimeter only counts those edges of a planning unit that are not shared in common with another selected planning unit in a cluster, and, therefore, compact clustering is encouraged. This article presents a new math programming model that incorporates this perimeter objective into the BMAS model. We present an application using data from the USDA Forest Service-funded Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project (Davis et al. 1996) and show that the model can be solved optimally by off-the-shelf software. Our tests indicate that the model can produce dramatic reductions in perimeter of the reserve system (increasing clustering and compactness) at the expense of relatively small decreases in performance against area and suitability measures.

Using 10 sets of data, representing two taxonomic groups and three ecoregions, we tested the effectiveness of a recently developed index for selection of umbrella species. We also tested whether species identified with the index were more effective umbrellas than species selected at random, evaluated whether sample size and intensity affect selection of umbrella species, and examined whether the index could identify cross-taxonomic umbrellas in a single ecoregion. Conserving all locations with at least one umbrella species would protect the vast majority of each assemblage. A more realistic scenario, conservation of subsets of locations with relatively high numbers of umbrella species, generally would protect Ն0.75 of each assemblage. Randomly selected sets of species often required that more locations be designated for protection than did sets selected using the umbrella index. The umbrella index tended to identify fewer locations that offered an equivalent level of species protection. Sampling intensity affected which species were identified as umbrellas, but not the proportion of species that would be protected. Umbrella species were no more effective than randomly selected species for cross-taxonomic applications; nonetheless, neither group was significantly less effective than same-taxon umbrellas. Particularly when selection of protected areas is not highly constrained, it may indeed be feasible to identify effective umbrella species. Unqualified utility of the umbrella index or umbrella species concept, however, is not supported by this study.},

Ectomycorrhizal macrofungi associated with woody species (Quercus robur, Q. cerris, Q. petraea, Tilia tomentosa, Carpinus betulus, Corylus avellana, and Q. pubescens) growing in a temperate, broadleaved mixed forest, from a hilly area near the city of Cluj\textendash Napoca, central Romania were included in a bipartite mutualistic network. Community structure was investigated using several network metrics, modularity and nestedness algorithms in conjunction with C-score index cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (the Kulczynski similarity was index used as most appropriate metric selected by minimal stress criterion). The results indicate that the network presents high asymmetry (hosts are outnumbered by mycobionts at a great extent), high connectance, low modularity, and high nestedness, competition playing a secondary role in community assemblage (non significant difference between simulated and observed Cscore). The nestedness pattern is non-random and is comparable to previously published results for other similar interactions containing plants. In the proposed network, woody species function exclusively as generalists. Modularity analysis is a finer tool were identifying species roles than centrality measures, however, the two types of algorithms permit the separation of species according to their roles as for example connectors (generalist species) and ultraperipheral species (specialists). Supergeneralist woody species function as hubs for the diverse ectomycorrhizal community while supergeneralist ectomycorrhizal fungi glue the hubs into a coherent aggregate.},

Resilience as persistence, adaptability, and transformability of complex adaptive social-ecological systems is the focus, clarifying the dynamic and forward-looking nature of the concept. Resilience thinking emphasizes that social-ecological systems, from the individual, to community, to society as a whole, are embedded in the biosphere. The biosphere connection is an essential observation if sustainability is to be taken seriously. In the continuous advancement of resilience thinking there are efforts aimed at capturing resilience of social-ecological systems and finding ways for people and institutions to govern social-ecological dynamics for improved human well-being, at the local, across levels and scales, to the global. Consequently, in resilience thinking, development issues for human well-being, for people and planet, are framed in a context of understanding and governing complex social-ecological dynamics for sustainability as part of a dynamic biosphere.},

We formulate a new conservation planning problem that aims to minimize the probability of missing conservation targets as a result of catastrophic events. To illustrate this approach we formulate and solve the problem of minimizing the impact of large-scale coral bleaching events on a reserve system for the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We show that by considering the threat of catastrophic events as part of the reserve design problem it is possible to substantially improve the likely persistence of conservation features within reserve networks for a negligible increase in cost. In the case of the Great Barrier Reef, a 2\% increase in overall reserve cost was enough to improve the long-run performance of our reserve network by .60\%. Our results also demonstrate that simply aiming to protect the reefs at lowest risk of catastrophic bleaching does not necessarily lead to the best conservation outcomes, and enormous gains in overall persistence can be made by removing the requirement to represent all bioregions in the reserve network. We provide an explicit and well-defined method that allows the probability of catastrophic disturbances to be included in the site selection problem without creating additional conservation targets or imposing arbitrary presence/absence thresholds on existing data. This research has implications for reserve design in a changing climate.},

Drawing on well-established principles of decision science, we highlight 6 mistakes commonly associated with setting priorities for conservation: not acknowledging conservation plans are prioritizations; trying to solve an illdefined problem; not prioritizing actions; arbitrariness; hidden value judgments; and not acknowledging risk of failure. We explain these mistakes and offer a path to help conservation planners avoid making the same mistakes in future prioritizations.},

In Learning-to-rank, boosted models such as RankBoost and LambdaMART have been shown to be among the best performing learning methods based on evaluations on public data sets. In this paper, we show how the combination of bagging as a variance reduction technique and boosting as a bias reduction technique can result in very high precision and low variance ranking models. We perform thousands of parameter tuning experiments for LambdaMART to achieve a high precision boosting model. Then we show that a bagged ensemble of such LambdaMART boosted models results in higher accuracy ranking models while also reducing variance as much as 50\%. We report our results on three public learning-to-rank data sets using four metrics. Bagged LamdbaMART outperforms all previously reported results on ten of the twelve comparisons, and bagged LambdaMART outperforms non-bagged LambdaMART on all twelve comparisons. For example, wrapping bagging around LambdaMART increases NDCG@1 from 0.4137 to 0.4200 on the MQ2007 data set; the best prior results in the literature for this data set is 0.4134 by RankBoost.},

Parameter optimization is computationally challenging for learning methods with many hyperparameters. In this paper we show that MapReduce Clusters are particularly well suited for parallel parameter optimization. We use MapReduce to optimize regularization parameters for boosted trees and random forests on several text problems: three retrieval ranking problems and a Wikipedia vandalism problem. We show how model accuracy improves as a function of the percent of parameter space explored, that accuracy can be hurt by exploring parameter space too aggressively, and that there can be significant interaction between parameters that appear to be independent. Our results suggest that MapReduce is a two-edged sword: it makes parameter optimization feasible on a massive scale that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago, but also creates a new opportunity for overfitting that can reduce accuracy and lead to inferior learning parameters.},

In this paper, the phase transition phenomena are investigated during compiling k-satisfiability problems into tractable languages with empirical methods. Ordered binary decision diagram and deterministic-decomposable negation normal form are selected as the tractable target languages for the compilation. Via intensive experiments, it can be concluded that an easy\textendash hard\textendash easy pattern exists during the compilations, which is only related to the ratio of the number of clauses to that of variables if we set k to a fixed value, rather than to the target languages. Moreover, it can be concluded that the space exhausted during the compilations grows exponentially with the number of variables growing, whereas there is also a phase transition separating the polynomial-increment region from the exponential-increment region. Additionally, it can be observed that there is a phase transition of prime implicants around peak points of the easy\textendash hard\textendash easy pattern and the ratios of random instances whose average lengths of prime implicants are larger than the threshold 0.5 change sharply. From these analyses, it can be concluded that prime implicant length and solution interchangeability are crucial impacts on sizes of compilation results.},

  abstract = {SUMMAry.\textemdash research in ecological networks has developed impressively in recent years. A significant part of this growth has been achieved using networks to represent the complexity of mutualistic interactions between species of birds and plants, such as pollination and seed dispersal. Bird-plant networks are built from matrices whose cells account for the field-sampled magnitudes of interaction (e.g. the number of plant fruits consumed by birds) in bird-plant species pairs. the comparative study of mutualistic networks evidences three general patterns in network structure: they are highly heterogeneous (many species having just a few interactions, but a few species being highly connected), nested (with specialists interacting with subsets of species with which generalists interact) and composed of weak and asymmetric relationships between birds and plants. this type of structure emerges from a set of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms accounting for the probabilistic role of species abundances and the deterministic role of species traits, often constrained by species phylogenies. Although bearing structural generalities, bird-plant networks are variable in space and time at very different scales: from habitat to latitudinal and biogeographical gradients, and from seasonal to inter-annual contrasts. they are also highly sensitive to human impact, being especially affected by habitat loss and fragmentation, defaunation and biological invasions. further research on bird-plant mutualistic networks should: 1) apply wide conceptual frameworks which integrate the mechanisms of interaction and the responses of species to environmental gradients, 2) enlarge the ecological scale of networks across interaction types and animal groups, and 3) account for the ultimate functional (i.e. demographic) effects of trophic interactions.},

This insolubility is partly due to the presence of `flawed variables,' variables whose values are all `flawed' (or unsupported). In this paper, we analyse how seriously existing work has been affected. We survey the literature to identify experimental studies that use models and parameters that may have been affected by flaws. We then estimate theoretically and measure experimentally the size at which flawed variables can be expected to occur. To eliminate flawed values and variables in the models currently used, we introduce a `flawless' generator which puts a limited amount of structure into the conflict matrix. We prove that such flawless problems are not trivially insoluble for constraint tightnesses up to 1/2. We also prove that the standard models B and C do not suffer from flaws when the constraint tightness is less than the reciprocal of domain size. We consider introducing types of structure into the constraint graph which are rare in random graphs and present experimental results with such structured graphs.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity is widely recognized as a valuable natural asset to conserve. Yet biodiversity is often reported to be declining worldwide. Biodiversity measures can help evaluating it and conserving it, but need to be clearly defined and assessed. In this paper, I review several biodiversity measures and develop a new one, all based on a matrix of species-level dissimilarity data. The data can be used in its raw form, regardless of its origin (e.g. studies of morphological traits, DNA hybridization experiments\ldots ) or of any graphical representation. Then, I propose a two-step assessment of the measures. First, I assess them in terms of their deviation from a strict additive law determining the contribution of each species to the diversity of the set in an ideal setting. This setting refers to a case where the data exactly determines the hierarchical ordering of the species. Second, I assess the measures based on their compliance with a list of axioms. These axioms reflect basic mathematical properties regarded as desirable for diversity measures, such as their monotonicity in species and dissimilarities. Finally, I show the importance of applying the new quantitative assessment and the axiomatic approach together when selecting a dissimilarity-based diversity measure.},

The goal of this paper is to use complex network methods to study dynamic and structure of competition under Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its evolution over time since its beginning until 2017. Using publicly available data, we construct a bipartite network of counties and insurance providers, create associated weighted single-mode networks, and analyze the evolution of network parameters that are related to competition and potential collusion in complex networks. These parameters have been previously tied to dynamics of collaboration and competition in earlier theoretical works. We argue that three parameters, namely network modularity, and eigenvector centrality mean and skewness are appropriate indicators of the overall competition in the insurance market. Based on these parameters, we show that the level of systemic competition among insurers as a function of time is an inverse U-shape trend, and that competition has returned back to what it was at the very beginning of ACA, indicating an undesirable resilience in the national health care system.},

A question that arises is, From where can we obtain knowledge of the problem structure via exact methods that can be exploited on large-scale problems by heuristic methods? We present a framework that allows the exploitation of existing techniques and resources to integrate such structural knowledge into the Ant Colony System metaheuristic, where the structure is determined through the notion of kernelization from the field of parameterized complexity. We give experimental results using vertex cover as the problem instance, and show that knowledge of this type of structure improves performance beyond previously defined ACS algorithms.},

We make an economic case for the spatial error model because it captures spatial dependence more fully (i.e. beyond that which can be attributed to the dependent variables in neighboring units). Also, when faced with the choice between aggregate or disaggregated data the spatial error model or a related model (e.g. the seemingly unrelated spatial error model) should be \ldots tted. This is to ensure that Wald tests of whole sets of coe\textcent{} cients against one another to establish if disaggregation is necessary are not invalidated. To illustrate the economic case which we make we extend the literature on the determinants of vehicle usage by modelling the spatial dependence of state travel for the U.S. over the period 1980 2008. On the basis of Wald tests, aggregate data on state vehicle usage is progressively disaggregated and spatial error models for travel on all twelve types of highway are \ldots tted. In all cases the spatial dependence in the spatial error models is greater than or approximately equal to that in the spatial lag models, con\ldots rming that the former does capture any additional sources of spatial dependence.},

Hard random problem distributions are an important source of such instances. Challenge problems from the area of nite algebra have also stimulated research on search and reasoning procedures. Nevertheless, the relation of such problems to practical applications is somewhat unclear. Realistic problem instances clearly have more structure than the random problem instances, but, on the other hand, they are not as regular as the structured mathematical problems. We propose a new benchmark domain that bridges the gap between the purely random instances and the highly structured problems, by introducing perturbations into a structured domain. We will show how to obtain interesting search problems in this manner, and how such problems can be used to study the robustness of search control mechanisms. Our experiments demonstrate that the performance of search strategies designed to mimic direct constructive methods degrade surprisingly quickly in the presence of even minor perturbations.},

We will show that these distributions are best characterized by a general class of distributions that have no moments (i.e., an infinite mean, variance, etc.). Such non-standard distributions have recently been observed in areas as diverse as economics, statistical physics, and geophysics. They are closely related to fractal phenomena, whose study was introduced by Mandelbrot. We believe this is the first finding of these distributions in a purely computational setting. We also show how random restarts can effectively eliminate heavy-tailed behavior, thereby dramatically improving the overall performance of a search procedure.},

We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.},

  abstract = {In response to the increasing loss of native vegetation and biodiversity, a growing number of countries have adopted ``offsetting'' policies that seek to balance local habitat destruction by restoring, enhancing and/or protecting similar but separate habitat. Although these policies often have a stated aim of producing a ``net gain'' or ``no net loss'' in environmental benefits, it is challenging to determine the potential impacts of a policy and if, or when, it will achieve its objectives. In this paper we address these questions with a general approach that uses predictive modelling under uncertainty to quantify the ecological impacts of different offset policies. This is demonstrated with a case study to the west of Melbourne, Australia where a proposed expansion of Melbourne's urban growth boundary would result in a loss of endangered native grassland, requiring offsets to be implemented as compensation. Three different offset policies were modelled: i) no restrictions on offset location, ii) offset locations spatially restricted to a strategically defined area and iii) offset locations spatially and temporally restricted, requiring all offsets to be implemented before commencing development. The ecological impact of the policies was determined with a system model that predicts future changes in the extent and condition of native grassland. The case study demonstrates how relative and absolute policy performance can be quantified in relation to best and worst-case scenarios. The study also shows that the ecological benefits of being temporally and spatially strategic in choosing offsets locations are substantially greater than being spatially strategic alone. We also show that even with considerable uncertainties in the system model predicting future grassland condition, the performance of the three offset policies can still be differentiated. Finally, we show the extent to which a policy achieves a ``net gain'' is dependent on the baseline against which policy performance is measured. The quantitative framework presented here can also be used to evaluate other offset policies or extended to deal with different types of environmental policies.},

  abstract = {To reduce global biodiversity loss, there is an urgent need to determine the most efficient allocation of conservation resources. Recently, there has been a growing trend for many governments to supplement public ownership and management of reserves with incentive programs for conservation on private land. At the same time, policies to promote conservation on private land are rarely evaluated in terms of their ecological consequences. This raises important questions, such as the extent to which private land conservation can improve conservation outcomes, and how it should be mixed with more traditional public land conservation. We address these questions, using a general framework for modelling environmental policies and a case study examining the conservation of endangered native grasslands to the west of Melbourne, Australia. Specifically, we examine three policies that involve: (i) spending all resources on creating public conservation areas; (ii) spending all resources on an ongoing incentive program where private landholders are paid to manage vegetation on their property with 5-year contracts; and (iii) splitting resources between these two approaches. The performance of each strategy is quantified with a vegetation condition change model that predicts future changes in grassland quality. Of the policies tested, no one policy was always best and policy performance depended on the objectives of those enacting the policy. This work demonstrates a general method for evaluating environmental policies and highlights the utility of a model which combines ecological and socioeconomic processes.},

We explored implications of basing conservation planning decisions on incomplete and biased data using occurrence records of the plant family Proteaceae in South Africa. Treating this high-quality database as \^Ocomplete\~O, we introduced three realistic sampling biases characteristic of biodiversity databases: a detectability sampling bias and two forms of roads sampling bias. We then compared reserve networks constructed using complete, biased, and randomly sampled data. All forms of biased sampling performed worse than both the complete data set and equal-effort random sampling. Biased sampling failed to detect a median of 1\textendash 5\% of species, and resulted in reserve networks that were 9\textendash 17\% larger than those designed with complete data. Spatial congruence and the correlation of irreplaceability scores between reserve networks selected with biased and complete data were low. Thus, reserve networks based on biased data require more area to protect fewer species and identify different locations than those selected with randomly sampled or complete data.},

However, the benefits of additional data have seldom been evaluated by analyzing the return on investment. If there are diminishing returns in terms of improved planning, then resources might be better directed toward other actions, depending on their relative costs and benefits. Our aim was to determine the return on investment from spending different amounts on survey data before undertaking a program of implementing new protected areas. We estimated how much protea data is obtained as a function of dollars invested in surveying. We then simulated incremental protection and loss of habitat to determine the benefit of investment in that data on the protection of proteas. We found that, after an investment of only US\$100,000 ({$\sim$}780,000 South Africa Rand [ZAR]), there was little increase in the effectiveness of conservation prioritizations, despite the full data set costing at least 25 times that amount.},

Different instances of the same problem present a different structure, and one aspect (e.g. feasibility or optimality) can prevail on the other. We have extracted from a set of BEP instances, a number of parameters representing the instance structure. Some of them (few indeed) precisely identify the best strategy and its corresponding tuning to be used to face that instance. We will show that this approach is very promising, since it identifies the most efficient algorithm in the 90\% of the cases.},

In many diverse scientific fields, the lack of availability, high cost or inconvenience of the collection of real-world data motivates the generation of synthetic data. In many experiments, the method chosen to generate synthetic data can significantly affect the results of an experiment. Unfortunately, the scientific literature does not contain general protocols for how synthetic data should be generated. The purpose of this chapter is to rectify that deficiency. The protocol we propose is based on several generation principles. These principles motivate and organize the data generation process. The principles are operationalized by generation properties. Then, together with information about the features of the application and of the experiment, the properties are used to construct a data generation scheme. Finally, we suggest procedures for validating the synthetic data generated. The usefulness of our protocol is illustrated by a discussion of numerous applications of data generation from the optimization literature. This discussion identifies examples of both good and bad data generation practice as it relates to our protocol.},

In this study, we compared analytically the conservation value of these two approaches. We locate this study in Danajon Bank, central Philippines, where many MPAs were established opportunistically based on community preference, with few if any contributions from biophysical data. We began by identifying the biophysical data that would have been available when the first MPA was created in Danajon Bank (1995). We next used these data with the reserve selection software Marxan to identify MPAs that covered the same area as is protected under the current set of MPAs (0.32\% of the total study area) and that would protect the greatest number of conservation targets at the lowest cost. We finally compared the conservation value of the current MPAs to the value of those selected by Marxan. Because of the dearth of biophysical data available in 1995 and the small area currently under protection, Marxan identified multiple configurations of MPAs that would protect the same percentage of conservation targets, with little differentiation among sites. Further, we discovered that the costs of obtaining and analyzing these data to be used for conservation planning would have been large relative to resources typically available to conservation planners in developing countries. Finally, we found that the current set of MPAs protected more ecological features than would be expected by chance, although not as many as could be protected using a systematic approach. Our results suggest that an opportunistic approach can be a valuable component of conservation planning, especially when biophysical data are sparse and community acceptance is a critical factor affecting the success of an MPA.},

State-space formulations of stochastic population growth models have been used to account for measurement error caused by the data collection process. Parameter estimation, inference, and prediction are all sensitive to measurement error. The observational process may also result in detection errors and if unaccounted for will result in biased parameter estimates. We developed an N-mixture state-space modeling framework to estimate and correct for errors in detection while estimating population model parameters. We tested our methods using simulated data sets and compared the results to those obtained with state-space models when detection is perfect and when detection is ignored. Our N-mixture state-space model yielded parameter estimates of similar quality to a state-space model when detection is perfect. Our results show that ignoring detection errors can lead to biased parameter estimates including an overestimated growth rate, underestimated equilibrium population size and estimated population state that is misleading. We recommend that researchers consider the possibility of detection errors when collecting and analyzing population time series data.},

One of the main detours is that algorithms are studied in terms of the hypothesis class that they draw their hypotheses from. In this paper, motivated by the luckiness framework of Shawe-Taylor et al. (1998), we study learning algorithms more directly and in a way that allows us to exploit the serendipity of the training sample. The main difference to previous approaches lies in the complexity measure; rather than covering all hypotheses in a given hypothesis space it is only necessary to cover the functions which could have been learned using the fixed learning algorithm. We show how the resulting framework relates to the VC, luckiness and compression frameworks. Finally, we present an application of this framework to the maximum margin algorithm for linear classifiers which results in a bound that exploits the margin, the sparsity of the resultant weight vector, and the degree of clustering of the training data in feature space.},

An extensive literature has reported a decline in efficiency of conservation outputs when planning at small spatial scales or when using large planning units. However, other key issues remain, such as the grain size used to represent the spatial distribution of conservation features. Here, we evaluate the effect of grain size of species distribution data vs. size of planning units on a set of performance measures describing efficiency (ratio of area where species are represented/ total area needed), rate of commission errors (species erroneously expected to occur), representativeness (proportion of species achieving the target) and a novel measure of overall conservation uncertainty (integrating commission errors and uncertainty in the actual locations where species occur). We compared priority areas for the conservation of freshwater fish in the Daly River basin (northern Australia). Our study demonstrates that the effect of grain size of species distribution data was more important than planning unit size on conservation planning performance, with an increase in commission errors up to 80\% and conservation uncertainty over 90\% when coarse data were used. This was more pronounced for rare than common species, where the mismatch between coarse representations of biodiversity patterns and the smaller areas of actual occupancy of species was more evident. Special attention should be paid to the high risk of misallocation of limited budgets when planning in heterogeneous or disturbed environments, where biodiversity is patchily distributed, or when planning for conservation of rare species.},

The first, previously recognized, is a peak in the median search cost near the connectivity at which half the graphs have solutions. This region contains a high proportion of relatively hard problem instances. However, the hardest instances are in fact concentrated at a second, lower, transition point. Near this point, most problems are quite easy, but there are also a few very hard cases. This region of exceptionally hard problems corresponds to the transition between polynomial and exponential scaling of the average search cost, whose location we also estimate theoretically. These behaviors also appear to arise in other constraint problems. This work also shows the limitations of simple measures of the cost distribution, such as mean or median, for identifying outlying cases.},

For example, cases that are difficult to solve with a variety of search methods are concentrated near these transitions. These studies show that a simple parameter describing the problem structure predicts the difficulty of solving the problem, on average. However, this prediction is associated with a large variance and depends on the somewhat arbitrary choice of the problem class. Thus these results are of limited direct use for individual instances. To help address this limitation, additional parameters, describing problem structure as well as heuristic effectiveness, are introduced. These are shown to reduce the variation in some cases. This also provides further insight into the nature of intrinsically hard search problems.},

The eld has started to settle into a methodology for such comparisons, which for obvious practical reasons requires running a subset of planners on a subset of problems. In this paper, we characterize the methodology and examine eight implicit assumptions about the problems, planners and metrics used in many of these comparisons. The problem assumptions are: PR1) the performance of a general purpose planner should not be penalized/biased if executed on a sampling of problems and domains, PR2) minor syntactic di erences in representation do not a ect performance, and PR3) problems should be solvable by STRIPS capable planners unless they require ADL. The planner assumptions are: PL1) the latest version of a planner is the best one to use, PL2) default parameter settings approximate good performance, and PL3) time cut-o s do not unduly bias outcome. The metrics assumptions are: M1) performance degrades similarly for each planner when run on degraded runtime environments (e.g., machine platform) and M2) the number of plan steps distinguishes performance. We nd that most of these assumptions are not supported empirically; in particular, that planners are a ected di erently by these assumptions. We conclude with a call to the community to devote research resources to improving the state of the practice and especially to enhancing the available benchmark problems.},

We found that performance, as measured by number of problems solved and computation time, varied with no one planner solving all the problems or being consistently fastest. Analysis of the data also showed that most planners either fail or succeed quickly and that performance depends at least in part on some easily observable problem/domain features. Based on these results, we implemented a meta-planner that interleaves execution of six planners on a problem until one of them solves it. The control strategy for ordering the planners and allocating time is derived from the performance study data. We found that our meta-planner is able to solve more problems than any single planner, but at the expense of computation time.},

  abstract = {Optimal risk-based levee designs are usually developed for economic efficiency. However, in river systems with multiple levees, the planning and maintenance of different levees are controlled by different agencies or groups. For example, along many rivers, levees on opposite riverbanks constitute a simple leveed river system with each levee designed and controlled separately. Collaborative planning of the two levees can be economically optimal for the whole system. Independent and self-interested landholders on opposite riversides often are willing to separately determine their individual optimal levee plans, resulting in a less efficient leveed river system from an overall society-wide perspective (the tragedy of commons). We apply game theory to simple leveed river system planning where landholders on each riverside independently determine their optimal risk-based levee plans. Outcomes from noncooperative games are analyzed and compared with the overall economically optimal outcome, which minimizes net flood cost system-wide. The system-wide economically optimal solution generally transfers residual flood risk to the lower-valued side of the river, but is often impractical without compensating for flood risk transfer to improve outcomes for all individuals involved. Such compensation can be determined and implemented with landholders' agreements on collaboration to develop an economically optimal plan. By examining iterative multiple-shot noncooperative games with reversible and irreversible decisions, the costs of myopia for the future in making levee planning decisions show the significance of considering the externalities and evolution path of dynamic water resource problems to improve decision-making.},

Over the past decade, a wide variety of techniques have been studied for building such models. Here, we describe extensions and improvements of existing models, new families of models, and\textemdash perhaps most importantly\textemdash a much more thorough treatment of algorithm parameters as model inputs. We also comprehensively describe new and existing features for predicting algorithm runtime for propositional satisfiability (SAT), travelling salesperson (TSP) and mixed integer programming (MIP) problems. We evaluate these innovations through the largest empirical analysis of its kind, comparing to a wide range of runtime modelling techniques from the literature. Our experiments consider 11 algorithms and 35 instance distributions; they also span a very wide range of SAT, MIP, and TSP instances, with the least structured having been generated uniformly at random and the most structured having emerged from real industrial applications. Overall, we demonstrate that our new models yield substantially better runtime predictions than previous approaches in terms of their generalization to new problem instances, to new algorithms from a parameterized space, and to both simultaneously.},

The ability to handle such response data allows us to adaptively censor costly function evaluations in minimization problems where the cost of a function evaluation corresponds to the function value. One important application giving rise to such censored data is the runtime-minimizing variant of the algorithm configuration problem: finding settings of a given parametric algorithm that minimize the runtime required for solving problem instances from a given distribution. We demonstrate that terminating slow algorithm runs prematurely and handling the resulting rightcensored observations can substantially improve the state of the art in model-based algorithm configuration.},

Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization. We first introduce a novel, linear-time algorithm for computing marginals of random forest predictions and then show how to leverage these predictions within a functional ANOVA framework, to quantify the importance of both single hyperparameters and of interactions between hyperparameters. We conducted experiments with prominent machine learning frameworks and state-of-the-art solvers for combinatorial problems. We show that our methods provide insight into the relationship between hyperparameter settings and performance, and demonstrate that\textemdash even in very highdimensional cases\textemdash most performance variation is attributable to just a few hyperparameters.},

We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm design scenarios differ in many ways, with important consequences for both automatic and manual algorithm design. We expect that both our methods and our findings will lead to tangible improvements in algorithm design methods.},

A simple way to do this is to choose a random truth assignment A, and then choose clauses randomly from among those satisfied by A. However, this method tends to produce easy problems, since the majority of literals point toward the ``hidden'' assignment A. Last year, (Achlioptas, Jia, \& Moore 2004) proposed a problem generator that cancels this effect by hiding both A and its complement A. While the resulting formulas appear to be just as hard for DPLL algorithms as random 3-SAT formulas with no hidden assignment, they can be solved by WalkSAT in only polynomial time.},

We considered why global biodiversity indicators are needed, what characteristics successful global indicators have, and how existing indicators perform. Because monitoring could absorb a large proportion of funds available for conservation, we believe indicators should be linked explicitly to monitoring objectives and decisions about which monitoring schemes deserve funding should be informed by predictions of the value of such schemes to decision making. We suggest that raising awareness among the public and policy makers, auditing management actions, and informing policy choices are the most important global monitoring objectives. Using four well-developed indicators of biological diversity (extent of forests, coverage of protected areas, Living Planet Index, Red List Index) as examples, we analyzed the characteristics needed for indicators to meet these objectives. We recommend that conservation professionals improve on existing indicators by eliminating spatial biases in data availability, fill gaps in information about ecosystems other than forests, and improve understanding of the way indicators respond to policy changes. Monitoring is not an end in itself, and we believe it is vital that the ultimate objectives of global monitoring of biological diversity inform development of new indicators.},

  abstract = {Ecological networks are a useful tool to study the complexity of biotic interactions at a community level. Advances in the understanding of network patterns encourage the application of a network approach in other disciplines than theoretical ecology, such as biodiversity conservation. So far, however, practical applications have been meagre. Here we present a framework for network analysis to be harnessed to advance conservation management by using plant \textendash{} pollinator networks and islands as model systems. Conservation practitioners require indicators to monitor and assess management effectiveness and validate overall conservation goals. By distinguishing between two network attributes, the `diversity' and `distribution' of interactions, on three hierarchical levels (species, guild/ group and network) we identify seven quantitative metrics to describe changes in network patterns that have implications for conservation. Diversity metrics are partner diversity, vulnerability/generality, interaction diversity and interaction evenness, and distribution metrics are the specialization indices d{${'}$} and H{${'}$}2, and modularity. Distribution metrics account for sampling bias and may therefore be suitable indicators to detect human-induced changes to plant \textendash pollinator communities, thus indirectly assessing the structural and functional robustness and integrity of ecosystems. We propose an implementation pathway that outlines the stages that are required to successfully embed a network approach in biodiversity conservation. Most importantly, only if conservation action and study design are aligned by practitioners and ecologists through joint experiments, are the findings of a conservation network approach equally beneficial for advancing adaptive management and ecological network theory. We list potential obstacles to the framework, highlight the shortfall in empirical, mostly experimental, network data and discuss possible solutions.},

We propose GeneRAting TIme Series with diverse and controllable characteristics, named GRATIS, with the use of mixture autoregressive (MAR) models. We generate sets of time series using MAR models and investigate the diversity and coverage of the generated time series in a time series feature space. By tuning the parameters of the MAR models, GRATIS is also able to efficiently generate new time series with controllable features. In general, as a costless surrogate to the traditional data collection approach, GRATIS can be used as an evaluation tool for tasks such as time series forecasting and classification. We illustrate the usefulness of our time series generation process through a time series forecasting application.},

The first step is to perform a noise test on each subsequence extracted from the series using a sliding window. All the subsequences recognised as noise are removed from further analysis, and the shapes are extracted from the remaining nonnoise subsequences. The second step is to cluster these extracted shapes. Although extracted from subsequences, these shapes form a non-overlapping set of time series subsequences and are hence amenable to meaningful clustering. The method is primarily designed for extracting and classifying shapes from very noisy real-world time series. Tests using artificial data with different levels of white noise and the red noise, and the real-world atmospheric turbulence data naturally characterised by strong red noise show that the method is able to correctly extract and cluster shapes from artificial data and that it has great potential for locating shapes in very noisy real-world time series.},

The first step is to perform a noise test on each subsequence extracted from the series using a sliding window. All the subsequences recognised as noise are removed from further analysis, and the shapes are extracted from the remaining nonnoise subsequences. The second step is to cluster these extracted shapes. Although extracted from subsequences, these shapes form a non-overlapping set of time series subsequences and are hence amenable to meaningful clustering. The method is primarily designed for extracting and classifying shapes from very noisy real-world time series. Tests using artificial data with different levels of white noise and the red noise, and the real-world atmospheric turbulence data naturally characterised by strong red noise show that the method is able to correctly extract and cluster shapes from artificial data and that it has great potential for locating shapes in very noisy real-world time series.},

  abstract = {Algorithm configuration methods optimize the performance of a parameterized heuristic algorithm on a given distribution of problem instances. Recent work introduced an algorithm configuration procedure (``Structured Procrastination'') that provably achieves near optimal performance with high probability and with nearly minimal runtime in the worst case. It also offers an anytime property: it keeps tightening its optimality guarantees the longer it is run. Unfortunately, Structured Procrastination is not adaptive to characteristics of the parameterized algorithm: it treats every input like the worst case. Follow-up work (``LeapsAndBounds'') achieves adaptivity but trades away the anytime property. This paper introduces a new algorithm, ``Structured Procrastination with Confidence'', that preserves the near-optimality and anytime properties of Structured Procrastination while adding adaptivity. In particular, the new algorithm will perform dramatically faster in settings where many algorithm configurations perform poorly. We show empirically both that such settings arise frequently in practice and that the anytime property is useful for finding good configurations quickly.},

The algorithm maintains a parameter vector with one non-negative weight per component, which always lies in the convex hull of the structured concept class. The algorithm predicts by decomposing the current parameter vector into a convex combination of concepts and choosing one of those concepts at random. The parameters are updated by first performing a multiplicative update and then projecting back into the convex hull. We show that Component Hedge has optimal regret bounds for a large variety of structured concept classes.},

Good-performing algorithms discovered by evolutionary algorithm can be reused on data sets of comparable complexity. Furthermore, these algorithms can be scaled up to model large data sets. We demonstrate how one particular template (simple ensemble of fast sigmoidal regression models) outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the Airline data set. Evolved hierarchical ensembles can therefore be beneficial as algorithmic building blocks in meta-learning, including meta-learning at scale.},

  abstract = {In this work we suggest a new model for generating random satisfiable               k               -CNF formulas. To generate such formulas. randomly permute all                                \$2\^k\textbackslash binom\{n\}\{k\}\$                              possible clauses over the variables               x               1               ,.~.~.,                                x                 n                              , and starting from the empty formula, go over the clauses one by one, including each new clause as you go along if, after its addition, the formula remains satisfiable. We study the evolution of this process, namely the distribution over formulas obtained after scanning through the first               m               clauses (in the random permutation's order).                                         Random processes with conditioning on a certain property being respected are widely studied in the context of graph properties. This study was pioneered by Ruci\'nski and Wormald in 1992 for graphs with a fixed degree sequence, and also by Erd\H{o}s, Suen and Winkler in 1995 for triangle-free and bipartite graphs. Since then many other graph properties have been studied, such as planarity and               H               -freeness. Thus our model is a natural extension of this approach to the satisfiability setting.                                         Our main contribution is as follows. For               m               {$\geq$}               cn               ,               c               =               c               (               k               ) a sufficiently large constant, we are able to characterize the structure of the solution space of a typical formula in this distribution. Specifically, we show that typically all satisfying assignments are essentially clustered in one cluster, and all but               e                                -{$\Omega$}(                 m                 /                 n                 )                              n               of the variables take the same value in all satisfying assignments. We also describe a polynomial-time algorithm that finds w.h.p. a satisfying assignment for such formulas.},

However, an algorithm that works whp has a drawback. Indeed for typical instances it works well, however for some rare inputs it does not provide a solution at all. Alternatively, one could require that the algorithm always produce a correct answer but perform well on average. Expected polynomial time formalizes this notion. We prove that for some natural distribution on 3CNF formulas, called planted 3SAT, our algorithm has expected polynomial (in fact, almost linear) running time. The planted 3SAT distribution is the set of satisfiable 3CNF formulas generated in the following manner. First, a truth assignment is picked uniformly at random. Then, each clause satisfied by it is included in the formula with probability p. Extending previous work for the planted 3SAT distribution, we present, for the first time for a satisfiable SAT distribution, an expected polynomial time algorithm. Namely, it solves all 3SAT instances, and over the planted distribution (with p = d/n2, d {$>$} 0 a sufficiently large constant) it runs in expected polynomial time. Our results extend to k-SAT for any constant k.},

  abstract = {One of the major obstacles in using neural networks to solve combinatorial optimization problems is the convergence toward one of the many local minima instead of the global minima. In this letter, we propose a technique that enables a self-organizing neural network to escape from local minima by virtue of the intermittency phenomenon. It gives rise to novel search dynamics that allow the system to visit multiple global minima as meta-stable states. Numerical experiments performed suggest that the phenomenon is a combined effect of Kohonen-type competitive learning and the iterated softmax function operating near bifurcation. The resultant intermittent search exhibits fractal characteristics when the optimization performance is at its peak in the form of 1/f signals in the time evolution of the cost, as well as power law distributions in the meta-stable solution states. The N-Queens problem is used as an example to illustrate the meta-stable convergence process that sequentially generates, in a single run, 92 solutions to the 8-Queens problem and 4024 solutions to the 17-Queens problem.},

When creating the portfolio, one needs to consider multiple objectives and constraints, identify promising action candidates and examine interactions among them. The area of portfolio decision analysis deals with such tasks. This paper reviews portfolio modelling approaches and software that are applicable in environmental management. A framework for environmental portfolio decision analysis is provided that consists of steps ranging from problem framing to modelling and optimization, as well as to the analysis of results. The use of this framework is demonstrated with an illustrative case describing planning of urban water services. The problem is analyzed with a recently introduced portfolio decision analysis method called Robust Portfolio Modelling, which enables the use of incomplete preference information and consequence data. This feature can be particularly useful in environmental applications.},

In spite of their utility and mathematical sophistication, these methods only provide approximate solutions to realworld problems where there is uncertainty and temporal change. The consequences of errors in these solutions are seldom characterized or addressed. We propose a conceptual structure for exploring the consequences of input uncertainty and oversimplified approximations to real-world processes for any conservation planning tool or strategy. We then present a computational framework based on this structure to quantitatively model species representation and persistence outcomes across a range of uncertainties. These include factors such as land costs, landscape structure, species composition and distribution, and temporal changes in habitat. We demonstrate the utility of the framework using several reserve selection methods including simple rules of thumb and more sophisticated tools such as Marxan and Zonation. We present new results showing how outcomes can be strongly affected by variation in problem characteristics that are seldom compared across multiple studies. These characteristics include number of species prioritized, distribution of species richness and rarity, and uncertainties in the amount and quality of habitat patches. We also demonstrate how the framework allows comparisons between conservation planning strategies and their response to error under a range of conditions. Using the approach presented here will improve conservation outcomes and resource allocation by making it easier to predict and quantify the consequences of many different uncertainties and assumptions simultaneously. Our results show that without more rigorously generalizable results, it is very difficult to predict the amount of error in any conservation plan. These results imply the need for standard practice to include evaluating the effects of multiple real-world complications on the behavior of any conservation planning method.},

  abstract = {Indicators of biodiversity have been proposed as a potential tool for selecting areas for conservation when information about species distributions is scarce. Although tests of the concept have produced varied results, sites selected to address indicator groups can include a high proportion of other species. We tested the hypothesis that species at risk of extinction are not likely to be included in sites selected to protect indicator groups. Using a reserve-selection approach, we compared the ability of seven indicator groups\textemdash freshwater fish, birds, mammals, freshwater mussels, reptiles, amphibians, and at-risk species of those six taxa\textemdash to provide protection for other species in general and at-risk species in particular in the Middle Atlantic region of the United States. Although sites selected with single taxonomic indicator groups provided protection for between 61\% and 82\% of all other species, no taxonomic group provided protection for more than 58\% of all other at-risk species. The failure to cover at-risk species is likely linked to their rarity. By examining the relationship between a species' probability of coverage by each indicator group and the extent of its geographic range within the study area, we found that species with more restricted ranges were less likely to be protected than more widespread species. Furthermore, we found that although sites selected with indicator groups composed primarily of terrestrial species (birds and mammals) included relatively high percentages of those species (82\textendash 85\%) they included smaller percentages of strictly aquatic species (27\textendash 55\%). Finally, of both importance and possible utility, we found that at-risk species themselves performed well as an indicator group, covering an average of 84\% of all other species.},

Through deception, such objective functions may actually prevent the objective from being reached. While methods exist to mitigate deception, they leave the underlying pathology untreated: Objective functions themselves may actively misdirect search towards dead ends. This paper proposes an approach to circumventing deception that also yields a new perspective on open-ended evolution: Instead of either explicitly seeking an objective or modeling natural evolution to capture open-endedness, the idea is to simply search for behavioral novelty. Even in an objective-based problem, such novelty search ignores the objective. Because many points in the search space collapse to a single behavior, the search for novelty is often feasible. Furthermore, because there are only so many simple behaviors, the search for novelty leads to increasing complexity. By decoupling open-ended search from artificial life worlds, the search for novelty is applicable to real world problems. Counterintuitively, in the maze navigation and biped walking tasks in this paper, novelty search significantly outperforms objective-based search, suggesting the strange conclusion that some problems are best solved by methods that ignore the objective. The main lesson is the inherent limitation of the objective-based paradigm and the unexploited opportunity to guide search through other means.},

This paper introduces to genetic programming a method that originated in neuroevolution (i.e. the evolution of artificial neural networks) that circumvents the problem of deceptive local optima. The main idea is to search only for behavioral novelty instead of for higher fitness values. Although such novelty search abandons following the gradient of the fitness function, if such gradients are deceptive they may actually occlude paths through the search space towards the objective. Because there are only so many ways to behave, the search for behavioral novelty is often computationally feasible and differs significantly from random search. Counterintuitively, in both a deceptive maze navigation task and the artificial ant benchmark task, genetic programming with novelty search, which ignores the objective, outperforms traditional genetic programming that directly searches for optimal behavior. Additionally, novelty search evolves smaller program trees in every variation of the test domains. Novelty search thus appears less susceptible to bloat, another significant problem in genetic programming. The conclusion is that novelty search is a viable new tool for efficiently solving some deceptive problems in genetic programming.},

The idea is that robustness may result not from detailed internal models or finely-tuned control policies but from cautious exploratory behavior. Supporting this hypothesis, robots trained to navigate mazes with a reactive disposition prove more robust than those trained over many trials yet not rewarded for reactive behavior in both simulated tests and when embodied in real robots. The conclusion is that robustness may neither require an accurate model nor finely calibrated behavior.},

Within artificial life, abstractions aiming to capture what makes natural evolution so powerful often focus on the idea of openendedness, which relates to boundless diversity, complexity, or adaptation. However, creative systems that have passed tests of open-endedness raise the possibility that openendedness does not always correlate to impressiveness in artificial life simulations. In other words, while natural evolution is both open-ended and demonstrates a drive towards evolving impressive artifacts, it may be a mistake to assume the two properties are always linked. Thus to begin to investigate impressiveness independently in artificial systems, a novel definition is proposed: Impressive artifacts readily exhibit significant design effort. That is, the difficulty of creating them is easy to recognize. Two heuristics, rarity and re-creation effort, are derived from this definition and applied to the products of an open-ended image evolution system. An important result is that that the heuristics intuitively separate different reward schemes and provide evidence for why each evolved picture is or is not impressive. The conclusion is that impressiveness may help to distinguish open-ended systems and their products, and potentially untangles an aspect of natural evolution's mystique that is masked by its co-occurrence with open-endedness.},

Traditional methods of training for robustness typically apply multiple non-deterministic evaluations with carefully modeled noisy distributions for sensors and effectors. In practice, such training is often computationally expensive and requires crafting accurate models. Taking inspiration from nature, where animals react appropriately to encountered stimuli, this paper introduces a measure called reactivity, i.e. the tendency to seek and react to changes in environmental input, that is applicable in single deterministic trials and can encourage robustness without exposure to noise. The measure is tested in four different maze navigation tasks, where training with reactivity proves more robust than training without noise, and equally or more robust than training with noise when testing with moderate noise levels. In this way, the results demonstrate the counterintuitive fact that sometimes training with no exposure to noise at all can evolve individuals significantly more robust to noise than by explicitly training with noise. The conclusion is that training for reactivity may often be a computationally more efficient means to encouraging robustness in evolved behaviors.},

  abstract = {As ecological data increases in breadth, depth, and complexity, the discipline of ecology is increasingly influenced by information science. While this influence provides many opportunities for ecologists, it also necessitates a change in how we manage and share data, and perhaps more fundamentally, define concepts in ecology. Specifically, the information technology process of automated data integration entirely depends upon consistent concept definition. A common tool used in computer science and engineering to specify meanings, which is both novel and offers significant potential to ecology, is an ontology. An ontology is a formal representation of knowledge in which concepts are described by their meaning and their relationship to each other. Ontologies are a tool that can be used to `explicitly specify a concept' (Gruber, 1993) and this approach is uncommon in ecology. In this paper, we develop an ontology for the concept of `landscape' that captures the most general definitions and usages of this term. We selected the concept of landscape because it is often used in very different ways by investigators and hence generates linguistic uncertainty. A graphic theoretic (i.e., visual) model is provided which describes the set of structuring rules we used to define the relationships between `landscape' and appropriately related terms. Based upon these rules, a landscape necessarily contains a spatial component (i.e., area), structure and function (i.e., ecosystems), and is scale independent. This approach provides the set of necessary conditions for landscape studies to reduce linguistic uncertainty, and facilitate interoperability of data, i.e., in a manner that promotes data linkages and quantitative synthesis particularly by automatic data synthesis programs that are likely to become an important part of ecology in the future. Simply put, we use an ontology, a technique novel to ecology but not other disciplines, to define `landscape,' thereby clearly delineating one subset of its potential general usage. As such this ontology can serve as both a checklist for landscape studies and a blueprint for additional ecological ontologies.},

Methods have been developed to incorporate climate change, population dynamics, and uncertainty in reserve design, but few studies have examined how to account for natural disturbance. Considering natural disturbance in reserve design may be especially important for the world's remaining intact areas, which still experience active natural disturbance regimes. We developed a spatially explicit, dynamic simulation model, CONSERV, which simulates patch dynamics and fire, and used it to evaluate the efficacy of hypothetical reserve networks in northern Canada. We designed six networks based on conventional reserve design methods, with different conservation targets for woodland caribou habitat, high-quality wetlands, vegetation, water bodies, and relative connectedness. We input the six reservenetworks into CONSERV and tracked the ability of each to maintain initial conservation targets through time under an active natural disturbance regime. None of the reservenetworks maintained all initial targets, and some over-representedcertain features, suggesting that both effectiveness and efficiency of reserve design could be improved through use of spatially explicit dynamic simulation during the planning process. Spatial simulation models of landscape dynamics are commonly used in natural resource management, but we provide the first illustration of their potential use for reservedesign. Spatial simulation models could be used iteratively to evaluate competing reserve designs and select targets that have a higher likelihood of being maintained through time. Such models could be combined with dynamic planning techniques to develop a general theory for reserve design in an uncertain world.},

  abstract = {Inspired by Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek, many economists have postulated the existence of invisible forces that drive economic markets. These market forces interact in complex ways making it difficult to visualize or understand the interactions in every detail. Here I show how these forces can transcend a zero-sum game and become a win-win business interaction, thanks to emergent social synergies triggered by division of labor. Computer simulations with the model Sociodynamica show here the detailed dynamics underlying this phenomenon in a simple virtual economy. In these simulations, independent agents act in an economy exploiting and trading two different goods in a heterogeneous environment. All and each of the various forces and individuals were tracked continuously, allowing to unveil a synergistic effect on economic output produced by the division of labor between agents. Running simulations in a homogeneous environment, for example, eliminated all benefits of division of labor. The simulations showed that the synergies unleashed by division of labor arise if: Economies work in a heterogeneous environment; agents engage in complementary activities whose optimization processes diverge; agents have means to synchronize their activities. This insight, although trivial if viewed a posteriori, improve our understanding of the source and nature of synergies in real economic markets and might render economic and natural sciences more consilient.},

Benchmarks based on Model RB have been successfully used by various international algorithm competitions and many research papers. In a previous work, Xu and Li defined two notions called i-constraint assignment tuple and flawed i-constraint assignment tuple to show an exponential resolution complexity of Model RB. These two notions are similar to some kind of consistency in constraint satisfaction problems, but seem different from all kinds of consistency so far known in literatures. In this paper, we explicitly define this kind of consistency, called variable-centered consistency, and show an upper bound on a parameter in Model RB, such that up to this bound the typical instances of Model RB are variable-centered consistent.},

Some variables in the solution cluster are frozen to the same spin values by one of two different mechanisms: frozen-core formation and long-range frustrations. While frozen cores are identified by a local whitening algorithm, long-range frustrations are very difficult to trace, and they make an entropic belief-propagation (BP) algorithm fail to converge. For BP to reach a fixed point the spin values of a tiny fraction of variables (chosen according to the whitening algorithm) are externally fixed during the iteration. From the calculated entropy values, we infer that, for a large random 3-SAT formula with constraint density close to the satisfiability threshold, the solutions obtained by the survey-propagation or the walksat algorithm belong neither to the most dominating clusters of the formula nor to the most abundant clusters. This work indicates that a single solution cluster of a random 3-SAT formula may have further community structures.},

Solving simultaneously the manager's and the investor's dynamic optimization programs in a fairly general framework, we characterize the optimal benchmark. We then provide completely explicit solutions when the investor's and the manager's utility functions exhibit different CRRA parameters. We find that, even under optimal benchmarking, it is never optimal for the manager, and therefore for the investor, to follow exactly the benchmark, except in a very restrictive case. We finally assess by simulation the practical importance, in particular in terms of the investor's welfare, of selecting a sub-optimal benchmark.},

Yet, the increasing dependence on species-distribution models in identifying conservation priorities calls for a more critical evaluation of model robustness. We used 11 bird species of conservation concern in Brazil's highly fragmented Atlantic Forest and data on environmental conditions in the region to predict species distributions. These predictions were repeated for five different model types for each of the 11 bird species. We then combined these species distributions for each model separately and applied a reserveselection algorithm to identify priority sites. We compared the potential outcomes from the reserve selection among the models. Although similarity in identification of conservation reserve networks occurred among models, models differed markedly in geographic scope and flexibility of reserve networks. It is essential for planners to evaluate the conservation implications of false-positive and false-negative errors for their specific management scenario before beginning the modeling process. Reserve networks selected by models that minimized false-positive errors provided a better match with priority areas identified by specialists. Thus, we urge caution in the use of models that overestimate species' occurrences because they may misdirect conservation action. Our approach further demonstrates the great potential value of museum records to biodiversity studies and the utility of species-distribution models to conservation decision-making. Our results also demonstrate, however, that these models must be applied critically and cautiously.},

This paper presents and analyses measures devoted to estimate the complexity of the function that should fitted to the data in regression problems. As case studies, they are employed as meta-features in three meta-learning setups: (i) the first one predicts the regression function type of some synthetic datasets; (ii) the second one is designed to tune the parameter values of support vector regressors; and (iii) the third one aims to predict the performance of various regressors for a given dataset. The results show the suitability of the new measures to describe the regression datasets and their utility in the meta-learning tasks considered. In cases (ii) and (iii) the achieved results are also similar or better than those obtained by the use of classical meta-features in meta-learning.},

  abstract = {Benchmark testing offers performance measurement for an evolutionary algorithm before it is put into applications. In this paper, a systematic method to construct a benchmark test suite is proposed. A set of established algorithms are employed. For each algorithm, a uniquely easy problem instance is generated by evolution. The resulting instances consist of a novel benchmark test suite. Each problem instance is favorable (uniquely easy) to one algorithm only. A hierarchical fitness assignment method, which is based on statistical test results, is designed to generate uniquely easy (or hard) problem instances for an algorithm. Experimental results show that each algorithm performs the best robustly on its uniquely favorable problem. The testing results are repeatable. The distribution of algorithm performance in the suite is unbiased (or uniform), which mimics any subset of real-world problems that is uniformly distributed. The resulting suite offers 1) an alternative benchmark suite to evolutionary algorithms; 2) a novel method of accessing novel algorithms; and 3) meaningful training and testing problems for evolutionary algorithm selectors and portfolios.},

Over this period, significant changes occurred in reference lists' features. On average, more recent papers have longer reference lists and cite more high Impact Factor papers and fewer non-journal publications. We also show that highly cited articles across the ecological literature have longer reference lists, cite more recent and impactful references, and include more self-citations. Conversely, the proportion of `classic' papers and non-journal publications cited, as well as the temporal span of the reference list, have no significant influence on articles' citations. From this analysis, we distill a recipe for crafting impactful reference lists, at least in ecology.},

This study from Finland addressed an issue of relative values of fallow and field margin biotopes in conservation of plant functional diversity (based on six functional traits of relevance to ecosystem services, and diversity of multiple traits) in agricultural landscapes differing in their structural complexity. Relative covers of plant species were surveyed in sampling plots located in perennial fallow fields and three types of perennial margins (margins between crop fields, along forest edges and by river) in three types of landscape context (simple, intermediate and complex). Fallow fields significantly contributed to the total functional diversity only in simple landscapes. The river margins provided the greatest functional diversity, especially in reproduction and regeneration traits while crop margins were consistently characterised by the lowest functional diversity. Substantial functional diversity of fallow patches in simple landscapes was due to high abundance of functional species, while that of river margins stemmed from presence of unique species. The plant functional diversity progressively declined with agricultural landscapes becoming simplified. The study indicates non-cropped biotopes having complementary roles in ensuring multifunctionality of agro-landscapes and confirms importance of biotope mosaic for functional diversity.},

The non-induced version allows extra edges in the target, whilst the induced version does not. Although both variants are NP-complete, algorithms inspired by constraint programming can operate comfortably on many real-world problem instances with thousands of vertices. However, they cannot handle arbitrary instances of this size. We show how to generate ``really hard'' random instances for subgraph isomorphism problems, which are computationally challenging with a couple of hundred vertices in the target, and only twenty pattern vertices. For the non-induced version of the problem, these instances lie on a satisfiable / unsatisfiable phase transition, whose location we can predict; for the induced variant, much richer behaviour is observed, and constrainedness gives a better measure of difficulty than does proximity to a phase transition. These results have practical consequences: we explain why the widely researched ``filter / verify'' indexing technique used in graph databases is founded upon a misunderstanding of the empirical hardness of NP-complete problems, and cannot be beneficial when paired with any reasonable subgraph isomorphism algorithm.},

However, our results show that individual decision problems can interact in very different ways, leading to different behaviour for each optimisation problem. Finally, we uncover a conflict between anytime and overall behaviour in algorithm design, and discuss the implications for the design of experiments and of search strategies such as variable- and value-ordering heuristics.},

Here, we review theoretical, empirical and statistical developments in the study of SADs. Several key points emerge. (i) Literally dozens of models have been proposed to explain the hollow curve. Unfortunately, very few models are ever rejected, primarily because few theories make any predictions beyond the hollow-curve SAD itself. (ii) Interesting work has been performed both empirically and theoretically, which goes beyond the hollow-curve prediction to provide a rich variety of information about how SADs behave. These include the study of SADs along environmental gradients and theories that integrate SADs with other biodiversity patterns. Central to this body of work is an effort to move beyond treating the SAD in isolation and to integrate the SAD into its ecological context to enable making many predictions. (iii) Moving forward will entail understanding how sampling and scale affect SADs and developing statistical tools for describing and comparing SADs. We are optimistic that SADs can provide significant insights into basic and applied ecological science.},

We consider the problem from the point of view of a new company which is interested in establishing new facilities on the network so as to maximize the company's "share of the market." Specifically, assume that the company gains an amount of wi in case customer i decides to switch over to one of the new facilities. Moreover, we assume that the decision to switch over is based on proximity only, i.e., customer i switches over to a new facility only if the latter is located at a distance less than ri from i. The problem is to locate p new facilities so as to maximize the total gain.},

Simple decision rules, such as protecting the available site with the highest irreplaceability or with the highest species richness, may be more effective when implementation occurs over many years.},

  abstract = {Connectivity is a fundamental concept that is widely utilized in spatial ecology. The majority of connectivity measures used in the recent ecological literature only consider the nearest neighbor patch/population, or patches within a limited neighborhood of the focal patch (a buffer). Meta-analysis suggests that studies using nearest neighbor connectivity measures are much less likely to find statistically significant effects of connectivity than studies that use more complex measures. Here we compare simple connectivity measures in their ability to predict colonization events in two large and good-quality empirical data sets. The nearest neighbor distance to an occupied patch is found to be an inferior measure. Buffer measures do much better, but their performance is found to be sensitive to the estimate of the buffer radius. For highly fragmented habitats, the best and most consistent performance is found for a measure that takes into account the size of the focal patch and the sizes of and distances to all potential source populations. When experimenting with reduced data sets, it was discovered that nearest neighbor measures fail to find a statistically significant effect of connectivity for a large range of data set sizes for which the more complex measures still detect a highly significant effect. We conclude that the simplicity of a nearest neighbor measure is not an adequate compensation for poor performance.},

  abstract = {It has been widely argued that habitat fragmentation is bad for (meta)population persistence and that a high level of fragmentation is a similarly undesirable characteristic for a reserve network. However, modelling the effects of fragmentation for many species is very difficult due to high data demands and uncertainty concerning its effect on particular species. Hence, several reserve selection methods employ qualitative heuristics such as boundary length penalties that aggregate reserve network structures. This aggregation usually comes at a cost because low quality habitats will be included for the sake of increased connectivity. Here a biologically justified method for designing aggregated reserve networks based on a technique called distribution smoothing is investigated. As with the boundary length penalty, its use incurs an apparent biological cost. However, taking a step further, potential negative effects of fragmentation on individual species are evaluated using a decision-theoretic uncertainty analysis approach. This analysis shows that the aggregated reserve network (based on smoothed distributions) is likely to be biologically more valuable than a more fragmented one (based on habitat model predictions). The method is illustrated with a reserve design case study in the Hunter Valley of south-eastern Australia. The uncertainty analysis method, based on information-gap decision theory, provides a systematic framework for making robust decisions under severe uncertainty, making it particularly well adapted to reserve design problems.},

  abstract = {Methods for reserve selection and conservation planning often ignore uncertainty. For example, presence-absence observations and predictions of habitat models are used as inputs but commonly assumed to be without error. We applied information-gap decision theory to develop uncertainty analysis methods for reserve selection. Our proposed method seeks a solution that is robust in achieving a given conservation target, despite uncertainty in the data. We maximized robustness in reserve selection through a novel method, ``distribution discounting,'' in which the site- and species-specific measure of conservation value (related to species-specific occupancy probabilities) was penalized by an error measure (in our study, related to accuracy of statistical prediction). Because distribution discounting can be implemented as a modification of input files, it is a computationally efficient solution for implementing uncertainty analysis into reserve selection. Thus, the method is particularly useful for high-dimensional decision problems characteristic of regional conservation assessment. We implemented distribution discounting in the zonation reserve-selection algorithm that produces a hierarchy of conservation priorities throughout the landscape. We applied it to reserve selection for seven priority fauna in a landscape in New South Wales, Australia. The distribution discounting method can be easily adapted for use with different kinds of data (e.g., probability of occurrence or abundance) and different landscape descriptions (grid or patch based) and incorporated into other reserve-selection algorithms and software.},

  abstract = {Several studies have compared the performances of exact algorithms (integer programming) and heuristic methods in the solution of conservation resource allocation problems, with the conclusion that exact methods are always preferable. Here, I summarize a potentially major deficiency in how the relationship between exact and heuristic methods has been presented: the above comparisons have all been done using relatively simple (linear) maximum coverage or minimum set models that are by definition solvable using integer programming. In contrast, heuristic or meta-heuristic algorithms can be applied to less simplified nonlinear and/or stochastic problems. The focus of this study is two kinds of suboptimality, first-stage suboptimality caused by model simplification and second-stage suboptimality caused by inexact solution. Evidence from comparisons between integer programming and heuristic solution methods suggests a suboptimality level of around 3\%\textendash 10\% for well-chosen heuristics, much depending on the problem and data. There is also largely anecdotal evidence from a few studies that have evaluated results from simplified conservation resource allocation problems using more complicated (nonlinear) models. These studies have found that dropping components such as habitat loss rates or connectivity effects from the model can lead to suboptimality from 5\% to 50\%. Consequently, I suggest that more attention should be given to two topics, first, how the performance of a conservation plan should be evaluated, and second, what are the consequences of simplifying the ideal conservation resource allocation model? Factors that may lead to relatively complicated problem formulations include connectivity and evaluation of long-term persistence, stochastic habitat loss and availability, species interactions, and distributions that shift due to climate change.},

This cost can be defined either in terms of loss of conservation value or in terms of extra acquisition cost, and it has a clear mathematical definition as a difference between the value of the unconstrained optimal solution and a constrained suboptimal solution. In this work we for the first time show how replacement cost can be calculated in the context of sequential reserve selection, where a reserve network is developed over a longer time period and ongoing habitat loss influences retention and availability of sites. In case of site exclusion, a question that can be asked is, ``if a site belonging to the ideal (optimal) solution cannot be obtained, what expected loss in reserve network value does this entail by the end of the planning period given that the rest of the solution is re-organized in the most advantageous manner?'' Heuristically, the proposed method achieves the ambit of combining irreplaceability and vulnerability into one score of site importance. We applied replacement cost analysis to conservation prioritization for wood-inhabiting fungi in Norway, identifying factors that influence replacement cost and urgency of site acquisition. Among other things we find that the reliability of loss rate information is important, because the optimal site acquisition order may be strongly influenced by underestimated loss rates.},

Unlike existing software for the study of network motifs,             pymfinder             allows the computation of node- and link-specific motif profiles as well as the analysis of weighted motifs. Beyond the overall characterization of networks, the tools presented in this work therefore allow for the comparison of the ``roles'' of either nodes or links of a network. Examples include the study of the roles of different species and/or their trophic/mutualistic interactions in ecological networks or the roles of specific proteins and/or their activation/inhibition relationships in protein-protein interaction networks. Here, we show how to apply the main tools from             pymfinder             using a predator-prey interaction network from a marine food web.             pymfinder             is open source software that can be freely and anonymously downloaded from             https://github.com/stoufferlab/pymfinder             , distributed under the MIT License (2018).},

  abstract = {Constraint satisfaction problems are of special interest for the artificial intelligence and operations research community due to their many applications. Although heuristics involved in solving these problems have largely been studied in the past, little is known about the relation between instances and the respective performance of the heuristics used to solve them. This paper focuses on both the exploration of the instance space to identify relations between instances and good performing heuristics and how to use such relations to improve the search. Firstly, the document describes a methodology to explore the instance space of constraint satisfaction problems and evaluate the corresponding performance of six variable ordering heuristics for such instances in order to find regions on the instance space where some heuristics outperform the others. Analyzing such regions favors the understanding of how these heuristics work and contribute to their improvement. Secondly, we use the information gathered from the first stage to predict the most suitable heuristic to use according to the features of the instance currently being solved. This approach proved to be competitive when compared against the heuristics applied in isolation on both randomly generated and structured instances of constraint satisfaction problems.},

  abstract = {Current human land use activities are altering many components of the river landscape, resulting in unstable channels. Instability may have serious negative consequences for water quality, aquatic and riparian habitat, and for river-related human infrastructure such as bridges and roads. Resource management agencies have developed rapid bioassessment surveys to help assess stability in a fast and cost-effective way. While this assessment can be done for a single site fairly rapidly, it is still time-consuming to apply over large watersheds and assessment activities must be prioritized. We constructed a system that employs commonly available map data as inputs to cost-sensitive variants of decision tree algorithms to predict the relative channel stability of different sites. In particular, we use bagged lazy option trees (LOTs) and bagged probability estimation trees (PETs) to identify all unstable channels while making the smallest number of errors of classifying stable channels as unstable, thereby minimizing cost and maximizing safety. We measured the performance of the classifiers using ROC curves and found that the PETs performed better than the LOTs in situations where the number of instances of the stable and unstable classes were relatively balanced, but the LOTs did better where unstable examples were relatively rare compared to stable, perhaps due to the LOTs' ability to focus on individual examples.},

Our technique, which we call ICARUS, models the portfolio design task as an election, in which each problem `votes' for a subset of preferred algorithms guided by a performance metric such as the number of fitness evaluations. The resulting `uncovered set' of algorithms forms the portfolio. We demonstrate the efficacy of ICARUS using a suite of stateof-the-art evolutionary algorithms and benchmark continuous optimization problems.

Given that statistical properties or features of a dataset affect the difficulty of an instance for particular classification algorithms, we examine the diversity and quality of the UCI repository of test instances used by most machine learning researchers.

We apply ensemble clustering to anomaly detection, hypothesizing that multiple views of the data will improve the detection of attacks. Each clustering rates how anomalous a point is; ratings are combined by averaging or taking either the minimum, the maximum, or median score. The evaluation shows that taking the median prediction from the cluster ensemble results in better performance than single clusterings. Surprisingly, averaging the individual predictions a) leads to worse performance than that of individual clusterings, and b) performs identically to taking the minimum prediction from the ensemble. This counter-intuitive result stems from asymmetric prediction distributions.},

An empirical bias/variance analysis as feature selection progresses indicates that the most accurate feature set corresponds to the best bias-variance trade-off point for the learning algorithm. Often, this is not the point separating relevant from irrelevant features, but where increasing variance outweighs the gains from adding more (weakly) relevant features. In other words, feature selection can be viewed as a variance reduction method that trades off the benefits of decreased variance (from the reduction in dimensionality) with the harm of increased bias (from eliminating some of the relevant features). If a variance reduction method like bagging is used, more (weakly) relevant features can be exploited and the most accurate feature set is usually larger. In many cases, the best performance is obtained by using all available features.},

Our approach is based on comparing the reference class of a measure to a number of known easy function classes. First, we generalize the reference classes of fitness distance correlation and epistasis variance, and construct a new predictive measure that is insensitive to nonlinear fitness scaling. We then investigate the relations between the reference classes of the measures and a number of intuitively easy classes such as the steepest ascent optimizable functions. Within the latter class, functions that fool the predictive quality of all of the measures are easily found. This points out the need to further identify which functions are easy for a given class of evolutionary algorithms in order to design more efficient hardness indicators for them. We finally restrict attention to the genetic algorithm (GA), and consider both GA-easy and GA-hard fitness functions, and give experimental evidence that the values of the measures, based on random samples, can be completely unreliable and entirely uncorrelated to the convergence quality and convergence speed of GA instances using either proportional or ranking selection.},

  abstract = {The impact of clustering on rank abundance, species-individual (5-N) and species-area curves was investigated using a computer programme for in silico sampling. In a rank abundance curve the abundances of species are plotted on log-scale against species sequence. In an 5-N curve the number of species (5) is plotted against the log of the total number of individuals (N) in the sample, in a species-area curve 5 is plotted against log-area. The results from in silico sampling confirm the general shape of 5-N and speciesarea curves for communities with clustering, i.e., a curve that starts with a smaller slope but that later is temporarily steeper than the curve expected for Poisson-distributed species. Extrapolation of 5-N and species-area curves could therefore be misleading. The output furthermore shows that sigmoid rank abundance curves (curves of the type of a log-normal or broken stick) can be an artefact of the standard procedure of first sorting the species in sequence of abundance in combination with clustering in the low abundant and rare species. This makes the usual explanation given to the log-normal rank abundance curve dubious. An extension of the negative-binomial rank abundance curve-fit model is discussed to make it suitable for also fitting sigmoid rank abundance curves.},

The calculation of the single-sample rank abundance curve is used in combination with the negative-binomial rank abundance curve-fit model to analyse the principal effect of clustering on the species-individual (S-N) curve and the species-area curve. With the usual plotting of S against log N or log area, assuming that N is proportional to area, S-N curves and species-area curves are the same curves with only a shifted horizontal axis. Clustering results in a lower recorded number of species in a sample and stretches the S-N curve and species-area curve over the horizontal axis to the right. In contrast to what is suggested in the literature, we surmise that the effect of clustering on both curves will gradually fade away with increasing sample size. Since the slopes of the curves are not constant, they cannot be used as species diversity indices or site discriminant. S-N curves and species-area curves cannot be extrapolated.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of learning when some cases are fully labeled while other cases are only partially labeled, in the form of partial labels. Partial labels are represented as a set of possible labels for each training example, one of which is the correct label. We introduce a discriminative learning approach that incorporates partial label information into the conventional margin-based learning framework. The partial label learning problem is formulated as a convex quadratic optimization minimizing the L2-norm regularized empirical risk using hinge loss. We also present an efficient algorithm for classification in the presence of partial labels. Experiments with different data sets show that partial label information improves the performance of classification when there is traditional fully-labeled data, and also yields reasonable performance in the absence of any fully labeled data.},

We present a formalism for learning related Bayes Net structures that takes advantage of the similarity between tasks by biasing toward learning similar structures for each task. Heuristic search is used to find a high scoring set of structures (one for each task), where the score for a set of structures is computed in a principled way. Experiments on synthetic problems generated from the ALARM and INSURANCE networks show that learning the structures for related tasks using the proposed method yields better results than learning the structures independently.},

We show that maximum margin methods such as boosted trees and boosted stumps push probability mass away from 0 and 1 yielding a characteristic sigmoid shaped distortion in the predicted probabilities. Models such as Naive Bayes, which make unrealistic independence assumptions, push probabilities toward 0 and 1. Other models such as neural nets and bagged trees do not have these biases and predict well calibrated probabilities. We experiment with two ways of correcting the biased probabilities predicted by some learning methods: Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression. We qualitatively examine what kinds of distortions these calibration methods are suitable for and quantitatively examine how much data they need to be effective. The empirical results show that after calibration boosted trees, random forests, and SVMs predict the best probabilities.},

  abstract = {Relations of simulated annealing and quantum annealing are studied by a mapping from the transition matrix of classical Markovian dynamics of the Ising model to a quantum Hamiltonian and vice versa. It is shown that these two operators, the transition matrix and the Hamiltonian, share the eigenvalue spectrum. Thus, if simulated annealing with slow temperature change does not encounter a difficulty caused by an exponentially long relaxation time at a first-order phase transition, the same is true for the corresponding process of quantum annealing in the adiabatic limit. One of the important differences between the classical-to-quantum mapping and the converse quantum-to-classical mapping is that the Markovian dynamics of a short-range Ising model is mapped to a short-range quantum system, but the converse mapping from a short-range quantum system to a classical one results in long-range interactions. This leads to a difference in efficiencies that simulated annealing can be efficiently simulated by quantum annealing but the converse is not necessarily true. We conclude that quantum annealing is easier to implement and is more flexible than simulated annealing. We also point out that the present mapping can be extended to accommodate explicit time dependence of temperature, which is used to justify the quantum-mechanical analysis of simulated annealing by Somma, Batista, and Ortiz. Additionally, an alternative method to solve the non-equilibrium dynamics of the one-dimensional Ising model is provided through the classical-to-quantum mapping.},

  abstract = {A large array of species distribution model (SDM) approaches has been developed for explaining and predicting the occurrences of individual species or species assemblages. Given the wealth of existing models, it is unclear which models perform best for interpolation or extrapolation of existing data sets, particularly when one is concerned with species assemblages. We compared the predictive performance of 33 variants of 15 widely applied and recently emerged SDMs in the context of multispecies data, including both joint SDMs that model multiple species together, and stacked SDMs that model each species individually combining the predictions afterward. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of these SDM approaches by examining their performance in predicting withheld empirical validation data of different sizes representing five different taxonomic groups, and for prediction tasks related to both interpolation and extrapolation. We measure predictive performance by 12 measures of accuracy, discrimination power, calibration, and precision of predictions, for the biological levels of species occurrence, species richness, and community composition. Our results show large variation among the models in their predictive performance, especially for communities comprising many species that are rare. The results do not reveal any major trade-offs among measures of model performance; the same models performed generally well in terms of accuracy, discrimination, and calibration, and for the biological levels of individual species, species richness, and community composition. In contrast, the models that gave the most precise predictions were not well calibrated, suggesting that poorly performing models can make overconfident predictions. However, none of the models performed well for all prediction tasks. As a general strategy, we therefore propose that researchers fit a small set of models showing complementary performance, and then apply a cross-validation procedure involving separate data to establish which of these models performs best for the goal of the study.},

As such, selecting and curating specific benchmarks remains an unnecessary burden on machine learning practitioners and data scientists. The present study introduces an accessible, curated, and developing public benchmark resource to facilitate identification of the strengths and weaknesses of different machine learning methodologies. We compare meta-features among the current set of benchmark datasets in this resource to characterize the diversity of available data. Finally, we apply a number of established machine learning methods to the entire benchmark suite and analyze how datasets and algorithms cluster in terms of performance. This work is an important first step towards understanding the limitations of popular benchmarking suites and developing a resource that connects existing benchmarking standards to more diverse and efficient standards in the future.},

  abstract = {In this paper we consider the rectilinear version of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). We define a class of edge-weighted graphs with nonnegatively valued bisections. For one important type of such graphs we provide a characterization of point sets on the plane for which the optimal value of the related QAP is zero. These graphs are used in the algorithms for generating rectilinear QAP instances with known provably optimal solutions. The basic algorithm of such type uses only triangles. Making a reduction from 3-dimensional matching, it is shown that the set of instances which can be generated by this algorithm is hard. The basic algorithm is extended to process graphs larger than triangles. We give implementation details of this extension and of four other variations of the basic algorithm. We compare these five and also two existing generators experimentally employing multi-start descent heuristic for the QAP as an examiner. The graphs with nonnegatively valued bisections can also be used in the construction of lower bounds on the optimal value for the rectilinear QAP.},

We develop a new method, called E-transformation, which makes use of this complexity transition, to find a suboptimal solution. With a random tree model, we show that, as the tree depth approaches infinity, the expected number of nodes expanded by branch-and-bound (BnB) using stransformation is at most cubic in the search depth, and that the relative error of the solution cost found with respect to the optimal solution cost is bounded above by a small constant. We also present an iterative version of c-transformation that can be used to find both suboptimal and optimal goal nodes. Depth-first BnB (DFBnB) using iterative Hransformation significantly improves upon DPBnB on random trees with large branching factors and deep goal nodes, finding a better solution sooner. We then present experimental results for ctransformation and iterative e-transformation on the asymmetric traveling salesman problem ( ATSP) and tbe maximum boolean satisfiability problem, and identify the conditions under which these two methods are effective. On the ATSP, DFBnB using Etransformation outperforms a well-known local search method, and DFBnB using iterative Etransformation improves upon DFBnB.},

  abstract = {Community ecology is tasked with the considerable challenge of predicting the structure, and properties, of emerging ecosystems. It requires the ability to understand how and why species interact, as this will allow the development of mechanism-based predictive models, and as such to better characterize how ecological mechanisms act locally on the existence of inter-specific interactions. Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions. By shifting the scale towards population-based processes, we show that this new approach will improve our predictive ability and mechanistic understanding of how species interact over large spatial or temporal scales.},

Using a simple demonstration model, this paper illustrates the problems that accumulated floating point errors can cause, and compares a number of techniques that might be used to address them. We show that inexact representation of parameter values, imprecision in calculation results, and differing implementations of mathematical expressions can significantly influence the behaviour of the model, and create issues for replicating results, though they do not necessarily do so. None of the techniques offer a failsafe approach that can be applied in any situation, though interval arithmetic is the most promising.},

At the core of this problem is the use of conservation measures (inputs, outputs, and outcomes) that do not explicitly address conservation impact, and thus risk undermining its achievement. These measures are used to formulate policy targets and operational objectives, gauge progress towards them, and identify priorities for action. In particular, the pervasive use of representation of biodiversity features as a sole basis for identifying priorities, and the considerable global effort directed towards increasing protected-area extent and assessing protected-area management effectiveness, exemplify that much conservation decision-making is founded more on belief systems than evidence. Measures such as the extent or representativeness of protected areas risk misdirecting conservation actions towards areas of low impact and misleading decision-makers and the public about conservation progress. To promote more effective, evidence-informed decision-making, analytical evidence can and should be used to test and refine decision-makers' implicit models of the world, focusing on predicting conservation impact - the future difference made by our future actions - to increase our effectiveness and accountability.},

The data characteristics were nestedness of features (land types in this case), rarity of features, size variation of sites (potential reserves) and size of data sets (numbers of sites and features). We manipulated data sets to produce three levels, with replication, of each of these data characteristics while holding the other three characteristics constant. We then used an optimizing algorithm and three heuristic algorithms to select sites to solve several reservation problems. We measured efficiency as the number or total area of selected sites, indicating the relative cost of a reserve system. Higher nestedness increased the efficiency of all algorithms (reduced the total cost of new reserves). Higher rarity reduced the efficiency of all algorithms (increased the total cost of new reserves). More variation in site size increased the efficiency of all algorithms expressed in terms of total area of selected sites. We measured the suboptimality of heuristic algorithms as the percentage increase of their results over optimal (minimum possible) results. Suboptimality is a measure of the reliability of heuristics as indicative costing analyses. Higher rarity reduced the suboptimality of heuristics (increased their reliability) and there is some evidence that more size variation did the same for the total area of selected sites. We discuss the implications of these results for the use of reserve selection algorithms as indicative and real-world planning tools.},

For conservation to be effective, decision-makers need to know what actions do and do not work. Ideally, decisions should be based on effectiveness as demonstrated by scientific experiment or systematic review of evidence. Can decision-makers get this kind of information? We undertook a formal assessment of the extent to which scientific evidence is being used in conservation practice by conducting a survey of management plans and their compilers from major conservation organizations within the UK. Data collected suggest that the majority of conservation actions remain experience-based and rely heavily on traditional land management practices because, many management interventions remain unevaluated and, although some evidence exists, much is not readily accessible in a suitable form. We argue that nature conservation along with other fields of applied ecology, should exploit the concept of evidence-based practice developed and used in medicine and public health that aims to provide the best available evidence to the decision-maker(s) on the likely outcomes of alternative actions. Through critical evaluation, we present the challenges and benefits of adopting evidence based practice from the decision-makers point of view and identify the process to be followed to make it work.},

Given the call from an increasingly influential environmental lobby for government and wider society to make both financial and personal sacrifices to address these problems, it seems likely that conservation biologists and environmental managers will be asked tough questions of the general form `are conservation interventions effective?' and, `are they doing more good than harm?' Science constantly advances and must remain open to challenge, but managers and policy formers require an interim product (an evidence-base) to underpin their current decision-making. The health services have been using the objective and transparent methodology of systematic review to summarise the evidence-base relating to the effectiveness of interventions. Environmental management has, up until now, had no formal shared evidence-base of this kind. Reviewing recent developments in evidence-based practice, this paper introduces a `systematic review' section for this journal and argues that constructing an evidence-based framework for environment management is possible, the challenge is scaling it up to engage the global scientific community. We draw on the history of evidence-based healthcare, but also on the differences between healthcare and conservation, to set out the challenges in creating a Collaboration for Environmental Evidence that develops a library of systematic reviews on the effectiveness of conservation and environmental interventions.},

This method has been argued to introduce uncontrolled sampling biases on statistical properties of the sample graph and heavy load to the network being measured. In order to improve the quality of the maps induced by the method, researchers are starting to investigate the deployment of large-scale distributed systems. But the lack of sources, the additional load introduced to the network and the potential uncontrolled scale in the IPv6 network cast a shadow over this direction. In this paper, we study traceroute sampling to represent the topology. Instead of finding a general strategy that would match all the graph properties, we focus on testing the impact of the proportion of destinations and sources on a single or several properties of the graph. We argue that, in order to obtain a more accurate sample graph, the general method of taking a small set of sources to perform traceroute-like probes to a large set of destinations is very unreasonable. Our results obtained from simulated experiments show that as the proportion of destinations and sources increases, the resulting properties of the sample graph can differ sharply from the underlying graph. The results also show that there is no single perfect proportion answer to meet all the graph properties but the small often perform better than the large overall. When we do the same measurement on several real-world networks, we find strong evidence for sampling bias because of taking so many destinations.},

Failure to acknowledge and treat uncertainty can lead to poor decisions. To illustrate the importance of considering uncertainty, we reanalyze a decision problem for the Sumatran rhino, Dicerorhinus sumatrensis, using information-gap theory to propagate uncertainties and to rank management options. Rather than requiring information about the extent of parameter uncertainty at the outset, information-gap theory addresses the question of how much uncertainty can be tolerated before our decision would change. It assesses the robustness of decisions in the face of severe uncertainty. We show that different management decisions may result when uncertainty in utilities and probabilities are considered in decision-making problems. We highlight the importance of a full assessment of uncertainty in conservation management decisions to avoid, as much as possible, undesirable outcomes.},

For multivariate data, such transitions have been observed frequently, but always as a function of the number of data points provided, i.e. given a large enough data set, two point clouds can always be recognized as different clusters, as long as their separation is non-zero. In contrast, for the sparse networks studied here, a cluster structure remains undetectable even in an infinitely large network if a critical separation is not exceeded. We give analytic formulas for this critical separation as a function of the degree distribution of the network and calculate the shape of the recoverability-transition. Our findings have implications for unsupervised learning and data-mining in relational data bases and provide bounds on the achievable performance of graph clustering algorithms.},

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

  abstract = {Publisher Summary The problem of selecting an effective algorithm arises in a wide variety of situations. This chapter starts with a discussion on abstract models: the basic model and associated problems, the model with selection based on features, and the model with variable performance criteria. One objective of this chapter is to explore the applicability of the approximation theory to the algorithm selection problem. There is an intimate relationship here and that the approximation theory forms an appropriate base upon which to develop a theory of algorithm selection methods. The approximation theory currently lacks much of the necessary machinery for the algorithm selection problem. There is a need to develop new results and apply known techniques to these new circumstances. The final pages of this chapter form a sort of appendix, which lists 15 specific open problems and questions in this area. There is a close relationship between the algorithm selection problem and the general optimization theory. This is not surprising since the approximation problem is a special form of the optimization problem. Most realistic algorithm selection problems are of moderate to high dimensionality and thus one should expect them to be quite complex. One consequence of this is that most straightforward approaches (even well-conceived ones) are likely to lead to enormous computations for the best selection. The single most important part of the solution of a selection problem is the appropriate choice of the form for selection mapping. It is here that theories give the least guidance and that the art of problem solving is most crucial.},

One of the most critical assumptions of network analysis is that the observed interaction patterns constitute an adequate sample of the set of interactions present in plant\textendash animal communities. In spite of its importance, few studies have evaluated this assumption, and in consequence, there is no consensus on the sensitivity of network metrics to sampling methodological shortcomings. In this study we examined how variation in sampling completeness influences the estimation of six network metrics frequently used in the literature (connectance, nestedness, modularity, robustness to species loss, path length, and centralization). We analyzed data of 186 flowering plants and 336 pollinator species in 10 networks from a forest-fragmented system in central Chile. Using species-based accumulation curves, we estimated the deviation of network metrics in undersampled communities with respect to exhaustively sampled communities and the effect of network size and sampling evenness on network metrics. Our results indicate that: (1) most metrics were affected by sampling completeness but differed in their sensitivity to sampling effort; (2) nestedness, modularity, and robustness to species loss were less influenced by insufficient sampling than connectance, path length, and centralization; (3) robustness was mildly influenced by sampling evenness. These results caution studies that summarize information from databases with high, or unknown, heterogeneity in sampling effort per species and should stimulate researchers to report sampling intensity to standardize its effects in the search for broad patterns in plant\textendash pollinator networks.},

However, land-use changes in such regions and delays between plan design and implementation may render optimized plans obsolete before implementation occurs. To measure the shelf life of cost-efficient conservation plans, we simulated a land-acquisition and restoration initiative aimed at conserving species at risk in Canada's farmlands. We accounted for observed changes in land-acquisition costs and in agricultural intensity based on censuses of agriculture taken from 1986 to 2011. For each year of data, we mapped costs and areas of conservation priority designated using Marxan. We compared plans to test for changes through time in the arrangement of high-priority sites and in the total cost of each plan. For acquisition costs, we measured the savings from accounting for prices during site selection. Land-acquisition costs and land-use intensity generally rose over time independent of inflation (24\textendash 78\%), although rates of change were heterogeneous through space and decreased in some areas. Accounting for spatial variation in land price lowered the cost of conservation plans by 1.73\textendash 13.9\%, decreased the range of costs by 19\textendash 82\%, and created unique solutions from which to choose. Despite the rise in plan costs over time, the high conservation priority of particular areas remained consistent. Delaying conservation in these critical areas may compromise what optimized conservation plans can achieve. In the case of Canadian farmland, rapid conservation action is cost-effective, even with moderate levels of uncertainty in how to implement restoration goals.},

We evaluated how the relative value of information on biodiversity features and land cost varied with data structure and variability, attributes of focal species and conservation targets, and habitat suitability thresholds for contrasting bird communities in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Specifically, we used spatial distribution maps for 20 bird species, land values, and an integer linear programming model to prioritize land units (1 km               2               ) that met conservation targets at the lowest estimated cost (hereafter `efficiency'). Across scenarios, the relative value of biodiversity data increased with conservation targets, as higher thresholds for suitable habitat were applied, and when focal species occurred disproportionately on land of high assessed value. Incorporating land cost generally improved planning efficiency, but at diminishing rates as spatial variance in biodiversity features relative to land cost increased. Our results offer a precise, empirical demonstration of how spatially-optimized planning solutions are influenced by spatial variation in underlying feature layers. We also provide guidance to planners seeking to maximize efficiency in data acquisition and resolve potential trade-offs when setting targets and thresholds in financially-constrained, spatial planning efforts aimed at maximizing ROI in biodiversity conservation.},

Although this has long been known, most published analyses persist in the use of intuitive heuristics, which cannot guarantee the optimality of the solutions found. Here, we dispute two of the most common justifications for the use of intuitive heuristics, namely that optimisation techniques are too slow and cannot solve the most realistic selection problems. By presenting an overview of processing times obtained when solving a diversity of reserve selection problems, we demonstrate that most of those published could almost certainly be solved very quickly by standard optimisation software using current widely available computing technology. Even for those problems that take longer to solve, solutions with low levels of sub-optimality can be obtained quite quickly, presenting a better alternative to intuitive heuristics. \# 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These data contain commission errors (when a species is mistakenly thought to be present) and omission errors (when a species is mistakenly thought to be absent), and the rates of the two types of error are inversely related. Point locality data can minimize commission errors, but those obtained from museum collections are generally sparse, suffer from substantial spatial bias and contain large omission errors. Geographic ranges generate large commission errors because they assume homogenous species distributions. Predicted distribution data make explicit inferences on species occurrence and their commission and omission errors depend on model structure, on the omission of variables that determine species distribution and on data resolution. Omission errors lead to identifying networks of areas for conservation action that are smaller than required and centred on known species occurrences, thus affecting the comprehensiveness, representativeness and efficiency of selected areas. Commission errors lead to selecting areas not relevant to conservation, thus affecting the representativeness and adequacy of reserve networks. Conservation plans should include an estimation of commission and omission errors in underlying species data and explicitly use this information to influence conservation planning outcomes.},

  abstract = {Global surrogate models (metamodels) are indispensable for numerical simulations over high-dimensional spaces. They typically use well-selected samples of the expensive code runs to produce a cheap-to-evaluate model. We introduce a new method to construct credible global surrogates with local accuracy without dictating where to sample: Voronoi Piecewise Surrogate (VPS) models. The key component in our method is to decompose the high-dimensional parameter space using an implicit Voronoi tessellation around the sample points as seeds. VPS assigns samples to cells using a simple nearest seed search, and finds cell neighbors via local hyperplane sampling, without constructing an explicit mesh. To avoid the intractable complexity of high-dimensional Voronoi cells, we construct an approximate dual Delaunay graph to establish a neighborhood network between cells. Each cell then uses information at its neighbors to build its own local piece of the global surrogate. This approach breaks down the high-order approximation problem into a set of piecewise low-order problems in the neighborhood of each function evaluation. The one-to-one mapping between the number of function evaluations and the number of Voronoi cells, regardless of the number of dimensions, eliminates the curse of dimensionality associated with standard domain decompositions. Furthermore, the Voronoi tessellation is naturally updated with the addition of new function evaluations. Due to its piecewise nature, VPS accurately handles smooth functions as well as functions with discontinuities, and can adopt a parallel implementation.},

Representation of biodiversity is necessary in reserve planning, but will ultimately fail for conservation unless factors affecting species' persistence are also incorporated. This study presents an empirical example of the divergent relationships among multiple metrics used to quantify a site's conservation value, including those that address representation (habitat type, species richness, species diversity), and others that address ecological processes and viability (density and reproductive capacity of a keystone species, in this case, the black chiton, Katharina tunicata). We characterized 10 rocky intertidal sites across two habitats in Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada, according to these site metrics. High-richness and high-production sites for K. tunicata were present in both habitat types, but high richness and high-production sites did not overlap. Across sites, species richness ranged from 29 to 46, and adult K. tunicata varied from 6 to 22 individuals m\`A2. Adult density was negatively correlated with species richness, a pattern that likely occurs due to post-recruitment growth and survival because no correlation was evident with non-reproductive juveniles. Sites with high adult density also contributed disproportionately greater potential reproductive output (PRO), defined by total gonad mass. PRO varied by a factor of five across sites and was also negatively correlated with species richness. Compromise or relative weighting would be necessary to select valuable sites for conservation because of inherent contradictions among some reserve selection criteria. We suspect that this inconsistency among site metrics will occur more generally in other ecosystems and emphasize the importance of population viability of strongly interacting species.},

On the other hand, the performance of this classifier appears strongly sensitive to training data complexity. In this context, by means of several problem difficulty measures, we try to characterize the behavior of the k-NN rule when working under certain situations.

The dominating set problem, which is NP-hard, consists of finding a smallest possible dominating set for a graph. The straightforward greedy strategy for finding a small dominating set in a graph consists of successively choosing vertices which cover the largest possible number of previously uncovered vertices. Several variations on this greedy heuristic are described and the results of extensive testing of these variations is presented. A more sophisticated procedure for choosing vertices, which takes into account the number of ways in which an uncovered vertex may be covered, appears to be the most successful of the algorithms which are analyzed. For our experimental testing, we used both random graphs and graphs constructed by test case generators which produce graphs with a given density and a specified size for the smallest dominating set. We found that these generators were able to produce challenging graphs for the algorithms, thus helping to discriminate among them, and allowing a greater variety of graphs to be used in the experiments.},

On small artificial data sets the optimal place prioritization algorithms often produced more economical solutions than the heuristic algorithms, though not always ones guaranteed to be optimal. However, with large data sets, the optimal algorithms often required long computation times and produced no better results than heuristic ones.

  abstract = {The recently developed concepts of aggregate risk and cumulative risk rectify two limitations associated with the classical risk assessment paradigm established in the early 1980s. Aggregate exposure denotes the amount of one pollutant available at the biological exchange boundaries from multiple routes of exposure. Cumulative risk assessment is defined as an assessment of risk from the accumulation of a common toxic effect from all routes of exposure to multiple chemicals sharing a common mechanism of toxicity. Thus, cumulative risk constitutes an improvement over the classical risk paradigm, which treats exposures from multiple routes as independent events associated with each specific route. Risk assessors formulate complex models and identify many realistic scenarios of exposure that enable them to estimate risks from exposures to multiple pollutants and multiple routes. The increase in complexity of the risk assessment process is likely to increase risk uncertainty. Despite evidence that scenario and model uncertainty contribute to the overall uncertainty of cumulative risk estimates, present uncertainty analysis of risk estimates accounts only for parameter uncertainty and excludes model and scenario uncertainties. This paper provides a synopsis of the risk assessment evolution and associated uncertainty analysis methods. This evolution leads to the concept of the scenario \textendash{} model \textendash{} parameter (SMP) cumulative risk uncertainty analysis method. The SMP uncertainty analysis is a multiple step procedure that assesses uncertainty associated with the use of judiciously selected scenarios and models of exposure and risk. Ultimately, the SMP uncertainty analysis method compares risk uncertainty estimates determined using all three sources of uncertainty with conventional risk uncertainty estimates obtained using only the parameter source. An example of applying the SMP uncertainty analysis to cumulative risk estimates from exposures to two pesticides indicates that inclusion of scenario and model sources increases uncertainty of risk estimates relative to those estimated using only the parameter source. Changes in uncertainty magnitude may affect decisions made by risk managers.},

In many real-world applications, however, it is practically infeasible to accurately parameterize the state transition function. In this study, we introduce a new way of dealing with ambiguity in the state transition function. In contrast to existing methods, we explore the effects of uncertainty at the level of the policy, rather than at the level of decisions within states. We use information-gap decision theory to ask the question of how much uncertainty in the state transition function can be tolerated while still delivering a specified expected value given by the objective function. Accordingly, the goal of the optimization problem is no longer to maximize expected value, but to maximize local robustness to uncertainty (while still meeting the desired level of performance). We analyze a simple land acquisition problem, using info-gap decision theory to propagate uncertainties and rank alternative policies. Rather than requiring information about the extent of parameter uncertainty at the outset, info-gap addresses the question of how much uncertainty is permissible in the state transition function before the optimal policy would change.},

Our framework for assessing sites and making land acquisition decisions represents a compromise between the use of generic spatial design criteria and more intensive computational tools, like spatially-explicit population models.

We develop a Bayesian network to assess site quality, which assigns an expected value to a property based on criteria arrayed into a causal diagram. We then use stochastic dynamic programming to determine whether an organization should acquire or reject a site placed on the public market. Our framework for assessing sites and making land acquisition decisions represents a compromise between the use of generic spatial design criteria and more intensive computational tools, like spatially-explicit population models. There is certainly a loss of precision by using site quality as a surrogate for more direct measures of persistence. However, we believe this simplification is defensible when sufficient data, expertise, or other resources are lacking.},

The larger this set is, the more accurate the abstraction will be. Thus, by varying the size of the IR set, we can examine the balance between the quality of the abstraction and the feasibility of the specification. Specifically, we examine each state variable that appears in the reward function and calculate the maximum range of the reward function for each of its values. In general, state variables with smaller ranges have greater overall effect on reward than variables with larger ranges; these should be retained first.},

The same is true when we make major financial decisions. Here people easily take advice from their fellow workers or relatives as to how to choose stock, balance a portfolio, or save for their child's education. Although some advice we get is from experts, most of the time we make our decisions relying only on the rather uninformed word-of-mouth advice we get from our friends or neighbors. We call this ?aive advice? In this paper I will outline a set of experimental results that indicate that word-of-mouth advice is a very powerful force in shaping the decisions that people make and tends to push those decisions in the direction of the predictions of the rational theory.},

Two of the main algorithms for solving systematic conservation planning problems are Simulated Annealing (SA) and exact integer linear programing (EILP) solvers. Using a case study in BC, Canada, we compare the cost-effectiveness and processing times of SA used in Marxan versus EILP using both commercial and open-source algorithms. Plans for expanding protected area systems based on EILP algorithms were 12\textendash 30\% cheaper than plans using SA, due to EILP's ability to find optimal solutions as opposed to approximations. The best EILP solver we examined was on average 1,071 times faster than the SA algorithm tested. The performance advantages of EILP solvers were also observed when we aimed for spatially compact solutions by including a boundary penalty. One practical advantage of using EILP over SA is that the analysis does not require calibration, saving even more time. Given the performance of EILP solvers, they can be used to generate conservation plans in real-time during stakeholder meetings and can facilitate rapid sensitivity analysis, and contribute to a more transparent, inclusive, and defensible decision-making process.},

These graphs are useful representations of the local and global complexity of the underlying systems. The origin of their topological structure can be diverse, resulting from different mechanisms including multiplicative processes and optimization. In spatial networks or in graphs where cost constraints are at work, as it occurs in a plethora of situations from power grids to the wiring of neurons in the brain, optimization plays an important part in shaping their organization. In this paper we study network designs resulting from a Pareto optimization process, where different simultaneous constraints are the targets of selection. We analyze three variations on a problem finding phase transitions of different kinds. Distinct phases are associated to different arrangements of the connections; but the need of drastic topological changes does not determine the presence, nor the nature of the phase transitions encountered. Instead, the functions under optimization do play a determinant role. This reinforces the view that phase transitions do not arise from intrinsic properties of a system alone, but from the interplay of that system with its external constraints.},

Even then, their difficulty is typically not quantified or considered, limiting the ability to interpret algorithmic performance on these datasets. Here, we introduce HAWKS, a new data generator that uses an evolutionary algorithm to evolve cluster structure of a synthetic data set. We demonstrate how such an approach can be used to produce datasets of a pre-specified difficulty, to trade off different aspects of problem difficulty, and how these interventions directly translate into changes in the clustering performance of established algorithms.},

Unlike prior work in citation analysis, we propose methods addressing these questions without requiring the availability of citation data. The methods use only the text of the documents as input. Consequentially, they are applicable to a much wider range of document collections (email, blogs, etc.), most of which lack meaningful citation data. We evaluate our methods on the proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference. Even with the preliminary methods that we implemented, the results show that the methods are effective and that addressing the questions based on the text alone is feasible.

  pages = {11},
  abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for assessing total model uncertainty using machine learning techniques. Historical model errors are assumed to be indicator of total model uncertainty. The model uncertainty is measured in the form of the model errors quantiles or prediction intervals (PIs) and such expression of uncertainty comprises all sources of uncertainty (e.g. model structure, model parameters, input data and output data etc.) without attempting to separate the contribution given by the individual sources of uncertainties. The method consists of partition of the model input data into different clusters. The data belonging to the same cluster have similar values of model errors (at least mean and variance). This is done by building a data matrix by combining (some of the) historical model inputs and corresponding model errors; partitioning this calibration data using clustering techniques such as crisp cluster or fuzzy clustering. PIs are constructed for each cluster by constructing empirical distribution of the model errors. The estimation of PIs for unseen test (or validation) data can be done by i) ``eager'' supervised classification, ii) instance-based (prototype) learning, and iii) supervised regression method. In classification method classifiers are built from the cluster labels and input data matrix and this classifier classifies the unseen input data. Estimation of PIs for the given input data consists of query of lookup table between cluster labels and PIs. In instance-based learning instead of building classifier, distance function is used to identify the cluster for the given validation input data, and represent it by its prototype (typically, its center). In regression method, PIs to each input in calibration data set are computed. Two regression models that estimate upper and lower PIs independently are trained from the input data matrix. The trained regression models are applied to estimate PIs in the unseen validation data set. The third approach was applied by Shrestha and Solomatine (2006) to estimate uncertainty of river flows. This paper presents the instance based approach to estimate the total model uncertainty of simulated river flows by HBV model of the case study of Brue catchment in United Kingdom.},

This approach was validated by comparing the uncertainty descriptors in the verification data set with those obtained by the MC simulation.

The results are quite promising as the prediction intervals estimated by the ANN are reasonably accurate.

However, MC simulation is not always practical for real time flow forecasting when computationally intensive models are used. Here we present an approach for assessment of model parametric uncertainty using machine learning techniques to replicate time consuming MC simulation. In this approach, firstly MC simulation is performed by sampling parameters form the given probability distribution. Secondly, the uncertainty descriptors such as quantiles or prediction intervals are estimated from the realizations of MC simulation.

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for estimating ``total'' predictive uncertainty using machine learning techniques. By the term ``total'' we mean that all sources of uncertainty are taken into account, including that of the input and observed data, model parameters and structure, without attempting to separate the contribution given by these different sources. We assume that the model error, which is mismatch between the observed and modelled value reflects all sources of uncertainty. Fuzzy c-means clustering was employed to cluster the input space into different zones or clusters assuming that the all the examples those belong to the particular cluster have similar model errors. The prediction interval is constructed for each cluster on the basis of empirical distributions of the historical model errors associated with all examples of the particular cluster. Prediction interval for the individual example is derived from cluster based prediction interval according to their membership grades in each cluster. Linear or non-linear regression model is then built in calibration data that approximates an underlying functional relationship between an input vector and the computed prediction intervals. Finally, this model is applied to estimate the prediction intervals in verification data. The method was tested on hydrologic datasets using various machine learning techniques. Preliminary results show that the method has certain advantage if compared to other methods.},

The goal of this paper is to further advance this area of research and provide new solutions to solve complex Spatial Conservation Planning (SCP) problems under uncertainty that consider risk preferences of decision makers. Our approach employs modern portfolio theory to address uncertainties in SCP problems, and involves two conflicting objectives: maximizing return and minimizing risk. We apply concepts from game theory such as the Nash bargaining solution to directly compute a desirable Pareto-optimal solution for the proposed bi-objective optimization formulation in natural resource management problems. We demonstrate with numerical examples that by directly computing a Nash bargaining solution, a Binary Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (BQCQP) can be solved. We show that our approach (implementable with commercial solvers such as CPLEX) can effectively solve the proposed BQCQP for much larger problems than previous approaches published in the ecological literature. Optimal solutions for problems with less than 400 parcels can be computed within a minute. Near optimal solutions (within at most 0.2\% gap from an optimal solution) for high-dimensional problems involving up to 800 parcels can be computed within 8 h on a standard computer. We have presented a new approach to solve SCP optimization problems while considering uncertainty and risk tolerance of decision makers. Our new approach expands considerably the applicability of such SCP optimization methods to address real conservation problems.},

The ultimate evaluation metric may not have been known to the modeler at training time, additional performance criteria may have been added, the evaluation metric may have changed over time, or the real-world evaluation procedure may have been impossible to simulate. But unforeseen ways of measuring model utility can degrade performance. Our objective is to provide experimental support for modelers who face potential ``cross-metric'' performance deterioration. First, to identify model-selection metrics that lead to stronger cross-metric performance, we characterize the expected loss where the selection metric is held fixed and the evaluation metric is varied. Second, we show that the number of data points evaluated by a selection metric has a substantial effect on the optimal evaluation. In trying to address both these issues, we hypothesize that whether classifiers are calibrated to output probabilities may influence these issues. In our consideration of the role of calibration, we show that our experiments demonstrate that cross-entropy is the highestperforming selection metric where little data is available for selection. With these experiments, modelers may be in a better position to choose selection metrics that are robust where it is uncertain what evaluation metric will be applied.},

In the empirical analysis the majority and the consensus ensemble voting schemes are studied. It is shown that increased diversity of ensembles using the majority voting scheme does not lead to better noise detection performance and may even degrade the performance of heterogeneous noise detection ensembles. On the other hand, for consensus-based noise detection ensembles the results show that more diverse ensembles achieve higher precision of class noise detection, whereas less diverse ensembles lead to higher recall of noise detection and higher F-scores. \& 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Noting that the classical benchmark test instances were limited in difficulty due to their selected structure, he proposed a set of new test instances for the 0-1 knapsack problem with characteristics that made them more challenging for dynamic programming and branch-and-bound algorithms. This important work highlighted the influence of diversity in test instances to draw reliable conclusions about algorithm performance. In this paper, we revisit the question in light of recent methodological advances \textendash{} in the form of Instance Space Analysis \textendash enabling the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms to be visualised and assessed across the broadest possible space of test instances. We show where the hard instances lie, and objectively assess algorithm performance across the instance space to articulate the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms. Furthermore, we propose a method to fill the instance space with diverse and challenging new test instances with controllable properties to support greater insights into algorithm selection, and drive future algorithmic innovations.},

Understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms in the portfolio is crucial for effective performance prediction, automated algorithm selection, and to generate knowledge about the ideal conditions for each algorithm to influence better algorithm design. Relying on well-studied benchmark instances, or randomly generated instances, limits our ability to truly challenge each of the algorithms in a portfolio and determine these ideal conditions. Instead we use an evolutionary algorithm to evolve instances that are uniquely easy or hard for each algorithm, thus providing a more direct method for studying the relative strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. The proposed methodology ensures that the meta-data is sufficient to be able to learn the features of the instances that uniquely characterise the ideal conditions for each algorithm. A case study is presented based on a comprehensive study of the performance of two heuristics on the Travelling Salesman Problem. The results show that prediction of search effort as well as the best performing algorithm for a given instance can be achieved with high accuracy.},

Instances are summarized by a set of features that correlate with difficulty, and we propose methods for visualizing instances and algorithm performance in this high-dimensional feature space. The footprint of an algorithm is where good performance can be expected, and we propose new metrics to measure the relative size of an algorithm's footprint in instance space. The methodology is demonstrated using the Traveling Salesman Problem as a case study.},

At the problem sizes studied experimentally, a phase transition is seen as the constraint tightness is varied. However, Achlioptas et al. showed that if the problem size (number of variables) increases while the remaining parameters are kept constant, asymptotically almost all instances are unsatis\"yable. In this paper, an alternative scheme for one of the standard models is proposed in which both the number of values in each variable's domain and the average degree of the constraint graph are increased with problem size. It is shown that with this scheme there is asymptotically a range of values of the constraint tightness in which instances are trivially satis\"yable with probability at least 0.5 and a range in which instances are almost all unsatis\"yable; hence there is a crossover point at some value of the constraint tightness between these two ranges. This scheme is compared to a similar scheme due to Xu and Li. c 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

In contrast to theoretical work, which is concerned with the asymptotic behaviour of problems as the number of variables becomes larger, this paper is concerned with the location of the phase transition in finite problems. The accuracy of a prediction based on the expected number of solutions is discussed; it is shown that the variance of the number of solutions can be used to set bounds on the phase transition and to indicate the accuracy of the prediction. A class of sparse problems, for which the prediction is known to be inaccurate, is considered in detail; it is shown that, for these problems, the phase transition depends on the topology of the constraint graph as well as on the tightness of the constraints.},

Mathematical models of environmental processes inevitably contain errors (even if models are calibrated on accurate data) which can be represented as realizations of a stochastic process. Parameters of this process vary in time and cannot be reliably estimated without making (unrealistic) assumptions. However the model errors depend on various factors characterizing environmental conditions (for example, for extreme events errors are typically higher), and such dependencies can be reconstructed based on data. We present a unifying approach allowing for building machine learning models (in particular ANN and Local weighted regression) able to predict such errors as well as the properties of their distributions. Examples in modelling hydrological processes are considered.},

This procedure ensures that the resulting model captures the additive structure of the response. A single Grove may still overfit to the training set, so we further decrease the variance of the final predictions with bagging. We show that in addition to exhibiting superior performance on a suite of regression test problems, Additive Groves are very resistant to overfitting.},

This data is very noisy - predictive models built from this data perform only slightly better than baseline. Previous approaches for interaction detection, including recently proposed algorithm based on Additive Groves, might not work ideally on such noisy data for a number of reasons. We describe the issues that appear when working with such data sets and suggest solutions to them. We further demonstrate that with our improvements to the interaction detection algorithm it is possible to detect interactions between important features and the response function, even when the data is this noisy. In the end, we show and interpret the results of our analysis for several bird species.},

Our method is based on comparing the performance of unrestricted and restricted prediction models, where restricted models are prevented from modeling an interaction in question.

The algorithm actively samples points for training that are most likely to improve the accuracy of the more promising candidate models, and also samples points for model selection\textemdash all samples count against the same labeling budget. This exposes a natural trade-off between the focused active sampling that is most effective for training models, and the unbiased sampling that is better for model selection. We empirically demonstrate on six test problems that this algorithm is nearly as effective as an active learning oracle that knows the optimal model in advance.},

A possible way to tackle this challenge is to attempt to understand the problem complexity. Fitness Landscape Analysis (FLA) metrics are widely used techniques to extract characteristics from problems. Based on the extracted characteristics, machine learning methods are employed to select the optimal algorithm for a given problem. Therefore, the accuracy of the algorithm selection framework heavily relies on the choice of FLA metrics. Although researchers have paid great attention to designing FLA metrics to quantify the problem characteristics, there is still no agreement on which combination of FLA metrics should be employed. In this paper, we present some well-performed FLA metrics, discuss their contributions and limitations in detail, and map each FLA metric to the captured problem characteristics. Moreover, computational complexity of each FLA metric is carefully analysed. We propose two criteria to follow when selecting FLA metrics. We hope our work can help researchers identify the best combination of FLA metrics.},

The efficient Bayesian multivariate surface regression approach is used to model forecast error as a function of features calculated from the time series.

In general, the performance of any meta-learner strongly depends on the reference dataset used to train the model. We further examine the feasibility of using GRATIS (a feature-based time series simulation approach) in generating a realistic time series collection to obtain a diverse collection of time series for our reference set. The proposed framework is tested using the M4 competition data and is compared against several benchmarks and other commonly used forecasting approaches. The new approach obtains performance comparable to the second and the third rankings of the M4 competition.},

We prove that the heuristics and the confidence interval are sound and produce with high probability an approximately optimal policy in polynomial time. Experiments on two benchmark problems and two instances of an invasive species management problem show that the improved confidence intervals and the new search heuristics yield reductions of between 8\% and 47\% in the number of simulator calls required to reach near-optimal policies.},

Most research on manipulation of voting methods studies (1) limited solution concepts, (2) limited preferences, or (3) scenarios with a few manipulators that have a common goal. In contrast, we study voting in plurality elections through the lens of Nash equilibrium, which allows for the possibility that any number of agents, with arbitrary different goals, could all be manipulators. This is possible thanks to recent advances in (Bayes-)Nash equilibrium computation for large games. Although plurality has numerous pure-strategy Nash equilibria, we demonstrate how a simple equilibrium refinement\textemdash assuming that agents only deviate from truthfulness when it will change the outcome\textemdash dramatically reduces this set. We also use symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibria to investigate the case where voters are uncertain of each others' preferences. This refinement does not completely eliminate the problem of multiple equilibria. However, it does show that even when agents manipulate, plurality still tends to lead to good outcomes (e.g., Condorcet winners, candidates that would win if voters were truthful, outcomes with high social welfare).},

In practice, though, they may face barriers to this knowledge due to transaction costs or bounded rationality.

We begin by proposing a taxonomy of auction models with valuation uncertainty and showing how it categorizes previous work. We then restrict ourselves to single-good sealed-bid auctions, in which agents have (uncertain) independent private values and can introspect about their own (but not others') valuations through possibly costly and imperfect queries. We investigate second-price auctions, performing equilibrium analysis for cases with both discrete and continuous valuation distributions. We identify cases where every equilibrium involves either randomized or asymmetric introspection. We contrast the revenue properties of different equilibria, discuss steps the seller can take to improve revenue, and identify a form of revenue equivalence across mechanisms.},

Decision-support tools that account for landscape heterogeneity are needed to identify spatially-explicit actions that will achieve the greatest biodiversity benefits with available resources. We developed a raster-based, landscape-scale, spatial conservation action planning tool (SCAP) that offers significant advances for prioritising local and regional scale conservation actions in heterogenous landscapes. The SCAP tool was developed for the state of Victoria, Australia, to integrate heterogeneity of landscapes, species distributions, threats, and man\- agement costs and benefits across the state. We used empirical data to derive current and pre-European set\- tlement distributions for 4400 native terrestrial species, and developed spatially explicit models of 19 threats to biodiversity. We coupled structured expert-elicitation techniques with machine learning to map the expected benefits to species, and the implementation costs, of 17 management actions \textendash{} alone and in combination. We then ranked location-specific actions by their cost-effective contribution to an overall objective of minimizing the risk of species loss in Victoria over the next 50 years, using a modified implementation of the Zonation conservation planning framework. The SCAP tool provides decision makers with a transparent decision-support tool for identifying the cost-effective management actions at scales relevant to management.},

We show that this problem can be addressed by a fully automated approach, leveraging recent innovations in Bayesian optimization. Specifically, we consider a wide range of feature selection techniques (combining 3 search and 8 evaluator methods) and all classification approaches implemented in WEKA, spanning 2 ensemble methods, 10 meta-methods, 27 base classifiers, and hyperparameter settings for each classifier. On each of 21 popular datasets from the UCI repository, the KDD Cup 09, variants of the MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10, we show classification performance often much better than using standard selection/hyperparameter optimization methods.

Here, we present a simple stochastic dynamic programming model that explores the conditions under which larvae may maximize their lifetime fitness by accepting lower quality habitat rather than continuing to search for superior habitat. Our model predicts that there is a relatively narrow range of parameter values over which larval selectivity among habitat types changes dramatically from 1 (larvae accept only optimal substrata) to 0 (indiscriminant settlement). This narrow range coincides with our best estimate of parameter values gleaned from empirical studies, and the model output matches data for the polychaete worm Hydroides dianthus remarkably well. The relative availability of habitats and the total time available to search for high quality habitat (i.e. the ability to delay metamorphosis) had the greatest effects on larval selectivity. In contrast, intuitive factors, including larval energetics and mortality, showed little effect on larval habitat preference, but could still alter the proportion of larvae settling in different habitats by reducing search time. Our model predicts that a given larva may behave differently depending on where it falls in the optimality decision matrix at the instant in which it locates substrata. This model provides a conceptual framework in which to conduct future studies involving variability in settlement decisions among individual larvae, and in which to consider the selective forces driving the evolution of specific larval settlement cues. Our results suggest that a combination of the maximum search period and the relative frequency and quality of optimal habitat likely exert the greatest influence on the evolution of larval selectivity in the field.},

  abstract = {Background: Co-evolution is the process in which two (or more) sets of orthologs exhibit a similar or correlative pattern of evolution. Co-evolution is a powerful way to learn about the functional interdependencies between sets of genes and cellular functions and to predict physical interactions. More generally, it can be used for answering fundamental questions about the evolution of biological systems. Orthologs that exhibit a strong signal of co-evolution in a certain part of the evolutionary tree may show a mild signal of co-evolution in other branches of the tree. The major reasons for this phenomenon are noise in the biological input, genes that gain or lose functions, and the fact that some measures of co-evolution relate to rare events such as positive selection. Previous publications in the field dealt with the problem of finding sets of genes that co-evolved along an entire underlying phylogenetic tree, without considering the fact that often co-evolution is local. Results: In this work, we describe a new set of biological problems that are related to finding patterns of local coevolution. We discuss their computational complexity and design algorithms for solving them. These algorithms outperform other bi-clustering methods as they are designed specifically for solving the set of problems mentioned above. We use our approach to trace the co-evolution of fungal, eukaryotic, and mammalian genes at high resolution across the different parts of the corresponding phylogenetic trees. Specifically, we discover regions in the fungi tree that are enriched with positive evolution. We show that metabolic genes exhibit a remarkable level of co-evolution and different patterns of co-evolution in various biological datasets. In addition, we find that protein complexes that are related to gene expression exhibit non-homogenous levels of co-evolution across different parts of the fungi evolutionary line. In the case of mammalian evolution, signaling pathways that are related to neurotransmission exhibit a relatively higher level of co-evolution along the primate subtree. Conclusions: We show that finding local patterns of co-evolution is a computationally challenging task and we offer novel algorithms that allow us to solve this problem, thus opening a new approach for analyzing the evolution of biological systems.},

  abstract = {Limited conservation resources mean that management decisions are often made on the basis of scarce biological information. Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly proposed as a way to improve the representation of biodiversity features in conservation planning, but the extent to which SDMs are used in conservation planning is unclear. We reviewed the peer-reviewed and grey conservation planning literature to explore if and how SDMs are used in conservation prioritisations. We use text mining to analyse 641 peer-reviewed conservation prioritisation articles published between 2006 and 2012 and find that only 10\% of articles specifically mention SDMs in the abstract, title, and/or keywords. We use topic modelling of all peer-reviewed articles plus a detailed review of a random sample of 40 peer-reviewed and grey literature plans to evaluate factors that might influence whether decision-makers use SDMs to inform prioritisations. Our results reveal that habitat maps, expert-elicited species distributions, or metrics representing landscape processes (e.g. connectivity surfaces) are used more often than SDMs as biodiversity surrogates in prioritisations. We find four main reasons for using such alternatives in place of SDMs: (i) insufficient species occurrence data (particularly for threatened species); (ii) lack of biologically-meaningful predictor data relevant to the spatial scale of planning; (iii) low concern about uncertainty in biodiversity data; and (iv) a focus on accounting for ecological, evolutionary, and cumulative threatening processes that requires alternative data to be collected. Our results suggest that SDMs are perceived as best-suited to dealing with traditional reserve selection objectives and accounting for uncertainties such as future climate change or mapping accuracy. The majority of planners in both the grey and peer-reviewed literature appear to trade off the benefits of using SDMs for the benefits of including information on multiple threats and processes. We suggest that increasing the complexity of species distribution modelling methods might have little impact on their use in conservation planning without a corresponding increase in research aiming at better incorporation of a range of ecological, evolutionary, and threatening processes.},

  abstract = {Conservation outcomes are uncertain. Agencies making decisions about what threat mitigation actions to take to save which species frequently face the dilemma of whether to invest in actions with high probability of success and guaranteed benefits or to choose projects with a greater risk of failure that might provide higher benefits if they succeed. The answer to this dilemma lies in the decision maker's aversion to risk\textemdash their unwillingness to accept uncertain outcomes. Little guidance exists on how risk preferences affect conservation investment priorities. Using a prioritization approach based on cost effectiveness, we compared 2 approaches: a conservative probability threshold approach that excludes investment in projects with a risk of management failure greater than a fixed level, and a variance-discounting heuristic used in economics that explicitly accounts for risk tolerance and the probabilities of management success and failure. We applied both approaches to prioritizing projects for 700 of New Zealand's threatened species across 8303 management actions. Both decision makers' risk tolerance and our choice of approach to dealing with risk preferences drove the prioritization solution (i.e., the species selected for management). Use of a probability threshold minimized uncertainty, but more expensive projects were selected than with variance discounting, which maximized expected benefits by selecting the management of species with higher extinction risk and higher conservation value. Explicitly incorporating risk preferences within the decision making process reduced the number of species expected to be safe from extinction because lower risk tolerance resulted in more species being excluded from management, but the approach allowed decision makers to choose a level of acceptable risk that fit with their ability to accommodate failure. We argue for transparency in risk tolerance and recommend that decision makers accept risk in an adaptive management framework to maximize benefits and avoid potential extinctions due to inefficient allocation of limited resources.},

  abstract = {One of the most pervasive forms of uncertainty in data used to make conservation decisions is error associated with mapping of conservation features. Whilst conservation planners should consider uncertainty associated with ecological data to make informed decisions, mapping error is rarely, if ever, accommodated in the planning process. Here, we develop a spatial conservation prioritization approach that accounts for the uncertainty inherent in coral reef habitat maps and apply it in the Kubulau District fisheries management area, Fiji. We use accuracy information describing the probability of occurrence of each habitat type, derived from remote sensing data validated by field surveys, to design a marine reserve network that has a high probability of protecting a fixed percentage (10\textendash 90\%) of every habitat type. We compare the outcomes of our approach to those of standard reserve design approaches, where habitatmapping errors are not known or ignored. We show that the locations of priority areas change between the standard and probabilistic approaches, with errors of omission and commission likely to occur if reserve design does not accommodate mapping accuracy. Although consideration of habitat mapping accuracy leads to bigger reserve networks, they are unlikely to miss habitat conservation targets. We explore the trade-off between conservation feature representation and reserve network area, with smaller reserve networks possible if we give up on trying to meet targets for habitats mapped with a low accuracy. The approach can be used with any habitat type at any scale to inform more robust and defensible conservation decisions in marine or terrestrial environments.},

  abstract = {A significant problem in wildlife management is identifying ``good'' habitat for species within the short time frames demanded by policy makers. Statistical models of the response of species presence/absence to predictor variables are one solution, widely known as habitat modeling. We use a ``virtual ecologist'' to test logistic regression as a means of developing habitat models within a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation that allows habitat quality to influence either fecundity or survival with a continuous scale. The basic question is how good are logistic regression models of habitat quality at identifying habitat where birth rates are high and death rates low (i.e., ``source'' habitat)? We find that, even when all the important variables are perfectly measured, and there is no error in surveying the species of interest, demographic stochasticity and the limiting effect of localized dispersal generally prevent an explanation of much more than half of the variation in territory occupancy as a function of habitat quality. This is true regardless of whether fecundity or survival is influenced by habitat quality. In addition, habitat models only detect a significant effect of habitat on territory occupancy when habitat quality is spatially autocorrelated. We find that habitat models based on logistic regression really measure the ability of the species to reach and colonize areas, not birth or death rates.},

  abstract = {A significant problem in wildlife management is identifying ``good'' habitat for species within the short time frames demanded by policy makers. Statistical models of the response of species presence/absence to predictor variables are one solution, widely known as habitat modeling. We use a ``virtual ecologist'' to test logistic regression as a means of developing habitat models within a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation that allows habitat quality to influence either fecundity or survival with a continuous scale. The basic question is how good are logistic regression models of habitat quality at identifying habitat where birth rates are high and death rates low (i.e., ``source'' habitat)? We find that, even when all the important variables are perfectly measured, and there is no error in surveying the species of interest, demographic stochasticity and the limiting effect of localized dispersal generally prevent an explanation of much more than half of the variation in territory occupancy as a function of habitat quality. This is true regardless of whether fecundity or survival is influenced by habitat quality. In addition, habitat models only detect a significant effect of habitat on territory occupancy when habitat quality is spatially autocorrelated. We find that habitat models based on logistic regression really measure the ability of the species to reach and colonize areas, not birth or death rates.},

  abstract = {Species diversity, and the various interactions that occur between species, supports ecosystems functioning and benefit human societies. Monitoring the response of species interactions to human alterations of the environment is thus crucial for preserving ecosystems. Ecological networks are now the standard method for representing and simultaneously analyzing all the interactions between species. However, deciphering such networks requires considerable time and resources to observe and sample the organisms, to identify them at the species level and to characterize their interactions. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, combined with network learning and modelling, can help alleviate these constraints. They are essential for observing cryptic interactions involving microbial species, as well as short-term interactions such as those between predator and prey. Here, we present three case studies, in which species associations or interactions have been revealed with NGS. We then review several currently available statistical and machine-learning approaches that could be used for reconstructing networks of direct interactions between species, based on the NGS co-occurrence data. Future developments of these methods may allow us to discover and monitor species interactions cost-effectively, under various environmental conditions and within a replicated experimental design framework.},

  abstract = {Systematic approaches to efficient reserve network design often make use of one of two types of site selection algorithm; linear programs or heuristic algorithms. Unlike with linear programs, heuristic algorithms have been demonstrated to yield suboptimal networks in that more sites are selected in order to meet conservation goals than may be necessary or fewer features are captured than is possible. Although the degree of suboptimality is not known when using heuristics, some researchers have suggested that it is not significant in most cases and that heuristics are preferred since they are more flexible and can yield a solution more quickly. Using eight binary datasets, we demonstrate that suboptimality of numbers of sites selected and biodiversity features protected can occur to various degrees depending on the dataset, the model design, and the type of heuristic applied, and that processing time is not dramatically different between optimal and heuristic algorithms. In choosing an algorithm, the degree of suboptimality may not always be as important to planners as the perception that optimal solvers have feasibility issues, and therefore heuristic algorithms might continue to be a popular tool for conservation planning. We conclude that for many datasets, feasibility of optimal algorithms should not be a concern and that the value of heuristic results can be greatly improved by using optimal algorithms to determine the degree of suboptimality of the results.},

  abstract = {Ensembles of classifiers are among the best performing classifiers available in many data mining applications, including the mining of data streams. Rather than training one classifier, multiple classifiers are trained, and their predictions are combined according to a given voting schedule. An important prerequisite for ensembles to be successful is that the individual models are diverse. One way to vastly increase the diversity among the models is to build an heterogeneous ensemble, comprised of fundamentally different model types. However, most ensembles developed specifically for the dynamic data stream setting rely on only one type of base-level classifier, most often Hoeffding Trees. We study the use of heterogeneous ensembles for data streams. We introduce the Online Performance Estimation framework, which dynamically weights the votes of individual classifiers in an ensemble. Using an internal evaluation on recent training data, it measures how well ensemble members performed on this and dynamically updates their weights. Experiments over a wide range of data streams show performance that is competitive with state of the art ensemble techniques, including Online Bagging and Leveraging Bagging, while being significantly faster. All experimental results from this work are easily reproducible and publicly available online.},

However, the most cost-efficient conservation plan can be very dissimilar to any other plan achieving the set of conservation objectives. This is problematic under conditions of implementation uncertainty (e.g., if all or part of the plan becomes unattainable). We determined through simulations of parallel implementation of conservation plans and habitat loss the conditions under which optimal plans have limited chances of implementation and where implementation attempts would fail to meet objectives. We then devised a new, flexible method for identifying conservation priorities and scheduling conservation actions. This method entails generating a number of alternative plans, calculating the similarity in site composition among all plans, and selecting the plan with the highest density of neighboring plans in similarity space. We compared our method with the classic method that maximizes cost efficiency with synthetic and real data sets. When implementation was uncertain\textemdash a common reality\textemdash our method provided higher likelihood of achieving conservation targets. We found that {$\chi$} , a measure of the shortfall in objectives achieved by a conservation plan if the plan could not be implemented entirely, was the main factor determining the relative performance of a flexibility enhanced approach to conservation prioritization. Our findings should help planning authorities prioritize conservation efforts in the face of uncertainty about future condition and availability of sites.},

These models are formulated with linear 0\textendash 1 programming and solved using standard optimisation software, but they were run on different platforms, resulting in discrepant or even conflicting messages with regard to their computational efficiency. A fair and accurate comparison of the convenience of these models would be important for conservation planners who use these models. In this article, we considered eight models presented in literature and tested their computational efficiency using randomly generated data sets containing up to 2000 sites. We focused on reserve contiguity and compactness which are considered crucial to species persistence. Our results showed that two of these models, namely Williams (2002) and \"Onal et al. (2016), stand out as the most efficient models. We also found that the relative efficiency of these models depends on the scope of analysis. Specifically, the Williams (2002) model solves more of the test problems when contiguity is the only spatial attribute and a large subset of the candidate sites needs to be selected. When compactness is considered also, the \"Onal et al. (2016) model generally performs better. Large scale models are found to be difficult to solve in a reasonable period of time. We discussed factors that may affect those models' computational efficiency, including model size, share of selected sites, model structure and input data. These results provide useful insight and guidance to conservation practitioners and researchers who focus on spatial aspects and work with large-scale data sets.},

We explored the sensitivity of systematic reserve selection by altering values of three essential variables. We used a 1:20,000\textendash scale terrestrial ecosystem map and habitat suitability data for 29 threatened vertebrate species in the Okanagan region of British Columbia, Canada. To these data we applied a reserve-selection algorithm to select conservation sites while altering selection unit size and shape, features of biodiversity (i.e., vertebrate species), and area conservation targets for each biodiversity feature. The spatial similarity, or percentage overlap, of selected sets of conservation sites identified (1) with different selection units was {$\leq$}40\%, (2) with different biodiversity features was 59\%, and (3) with different conservation targets was {$\geq$}94\%. Because any selected set of sites is only one of many possible sets, we also compared the conservation value (irreplaceability) of all sites in the region for each variation of the data. The correlations of irreplaceability were weak for different selection units (0.23 {$\leq$} r {$\leq$} 0.67), strong for different biodiversity features (r = 0.84), and mixed for different conservation targets (r = 0.16; 0.16; 1.00). Because of the low congruence of selected sites and weak correlations of irreplaceability for different selection units, recommendations from studies that have been applied at only one spatial scale must be considered cautiously.},

However, they are of limited use in explaining and predicting the performance of algorithms on individual problem instances. We argue that the development of empirical methods for characterizing problem difficulty at the instance level is necessary for an advanced understanding of algorithm behavior. Further, the practical benefit is tremendous, enabling 1) the development of more comprehensive benchmarks, 2) problem-sensitive algorithm selection, and 3) intelligent tuning of problem-sensitive algorithm parameters.},

In this paper we describe a substantial extension of Marxan called Marxan with Zones, a decision support tool that provides landuse zoning options in geographical regions for biodiversity conservation. We describe new functions designed to enhance the original Marxan software and expand on its utility as a decision support tool. The major new element in the decision problem is allowing any parcel of land or sea to be allocated to a specific zone, not just reserved or unreserved. Each zone then has the option of its own actions, objectives and constraints, with the flexibility to define the contribution of each zone to achieve targets for pre-specified features (e.g. species or habitats). The objective is to minimize the total cost of implementing the zoning plan while ensuring a variety of conservation and land-use objectives are achieved. We outline the capabilities, limitations and additional data requirements of this new software and perform a comparison with the original version of Marxan. We feature a number of case studies to demonstrate the functionality of the software and highlight its flexibility to address a range of complex spatial planning problems. These studies demonstrate the design of multiple-use marine parks in both Western Australia and California, and the zoning of forest use in East Kalimantan.},

Species distribution modeling can be used as a tool to solve many theoretical and applied ecological and environmental problems, which include testing biogeographical, ecological and evolutionary hypotheses, assessing species invasion and climate change impact, and supporting conservation planning and reserve selection. The utility of SDM in real world applications requires the knowledge of the model's accuracy. The accuracy of a model includes two aspects: discrimination capacity and reliability. The former is the power of the model to differentiate presences from absences; and the latter refers to the capability of the predicted probabilities to reflect the observed proportion of sites occupied by the subject species.},

  abstract = {Test suites for many domains often fail to model features present in real-world problems. For the permutation ow-shop sequencing problem (PFSP), the most popular test suite consists of problems whose features are generated from a single uniform random distribution. Synthetic generation of problems with characteristics present in real-world problems is a viable alternative. We compare the performance of several competitive algorithms on problems produced with such a generator. We nd that, as more realistic characteristics are introduced, the performance of a stateof-the-art algorithm degrades rapidly: faster and less complex stochastic algorithms provide superior performance. Our empirical results show that small changes in problem structure or problem size can in uence algorithm performance. We hypothesize that these performance di erences may be partially due to di erences in search space topologies; we show that structured problems produce topologies with performance plateaus. Algorithm sensitivity to problem characteristics suggests the need to construct test suites more representative of real-world applications.},

In areas such as planning and finite model-checking, current solution techniques can handle combinatorial problems with up to a million variables and five million constraints. The good scaling behavior of these methods appears to defy what one would expect based on a worst-case complexity analysis. In order to bridge this gap between theory and practice, we propose a new framework for studying the complexity of these techniques on practical problem instances. In particular, our approach incorporates general structural properties observed in practical problem instances into the formal complexity analysis. We introduce a notion of ``backdoors'', which are small sets of variables that capture the overall combinatorics of the problem instance. We provide empirical results showing the existence of such backdoors in real-world problems. We then present a series of complexity results that explain the good scaling behavior of current reasoning and constraint methods observed on practical problem instances.},

We develop this analysis to show how an initial assemblage of species with varying interaction strengths is predicted to sort out into the final community based on the species\~O predicted target densities. The sorting process yields predictions of covarying patterns of species abundance, community size, and species interaction strengths.

For what we believe is the first time, we evaluate each of these models in a meta-analysis, taking as our data set large-scale and publicly-available experimental data from the literature.

However, a crisp boundary between these concepts has proven elusive. This problem is pervasive throughout the game theoretic literature on bounded rationality. It is particularly critical in parts of the behavioral game theory literature that make an explicit distinction between the behavior of ``nonstrategic'' level-0 agents and ``strategic'' higher-level agents (e.g., the level-k and cognitive hierarchy models). The literature gives no clear guidance on how the rationality of nonstrategic agents must be bounded, instead typically just singling out specific decision rules and informally asserting them to be nonstrategic (e.g., truthfully revealing private information; randomizing uniformly). In this work, we propose a new, formal characterization of nonstrategic behavior. Our main contribution is to show that it satisfies two properties: (1) it is general enough to capture all purportedly ``nonstrategic'' decision rules of which we are aware; (2) behavior that obeys our characterization is distinct from strategic behavior in a precise sense.},

  abstract = {Behavioral game theory seeks to describe the way actual people (as compared to idealized, ``rational'' agents) act in strategic situations. Our own recent work has identified iterative models, such as quantal cognitive hierarchy, as the state of the art for predicting human play in unrepeated, simultaneous-move games. Iterative models predict that agents reason iteratively about their opponents, building up from a specification of nonstrategic behavior called level-0. A modeler is in principle free to choose any description of level-0 behavior that makes sense for a given setting. However, in practice almost all existing work specifies this behavior as a uniform distribution over actions. In most games it is not plausible that even nonstrategic agents would choose an action uniformly at random, nor that other agents would expect them to do so. A more accurate model for level-0 behavior has the potential to dramatically improve predictions of human behavior, since a substantial fraction of agents may play level-0 strategies directly, and furthermore since iterative models ground all higher-level strategies in responses to the level-0 strategy. Our work considers models of the way in which level-0 agents construct a probability distribution over actions, given an arbitrary game. We considered a large space of alternatives and, in the end, recommend a model that achieved excellent performance across the board: a linear weighting of four binary features, each of which is general in the sense that it can be computed from any normal form game. Adding real-valued variants of the same four features yielded further improvements in performance, albeit with a corresponding increase in the number of parameters needing to be estimated. We evaluated the effects of combining these new level-0 models with several iterative models and observed large improvements in predictive accuracy.},

  abstract = {This paper first analyzes the resolution complexity of two random CSP models (i.e. Model RB/RD) for which we can establish the existence of phase transitions and identify the threshold points exactly. By encoding CSPs into CNF formulas, it is proved that almost all instances of Model RB/RD have no tree-like resolution proofs of less than exponential size. Thus, we not only introduce new families of CNF formulas hard for resolution, which is a central task of Proof-Complexity theory, but also propose models with both many hard instances and exact phase transitions. Then, the implications of such models are addressed. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that an application of Model RB/RD might be in the generation of hard satisfiable instances, which is not only of practical importance but also related to some open problems in cryptography such as generating one-way functions. Subsequently, a further theoretical support for the generation method is shown by establishing exponential lower bounds on the complexity of solving random satisfiable and forced satisfiable instances of RB/RD near the threshold. Finally, conclusions are presented, as well as a detailed comparison of Model RB/RD with the Hamiltonian cycle problem and random 3-SAT, which, respectively, exhibit three different kinds of phase transition behavior in NP-complete problems.},

Indeed, these models, called RB and RD, present several nice features. First, it is quite easy to generate random instances of any arity since no particular structure has to be integrated, or property enforced, in such instances. Then, the existence of an asymptotic phase transition can be guaranteed while applying a limited restriction on domain size and on constraint tightness. In that case, a threshold point can be precisely located and all instances have the guarantee to be hard at the threshold, i.e., to have an exponential tree-resolution complexity.

Indeed, these models, called RB and RD, present several nice features. First, it is quite easy to generate random instances of any arity since no particular structure has to be integrated, or property enforced, in such instances. Then, the existence of an asymptotic phase transition can be guaranteed while applying a limited restriction on domain size and on constraint tightness. In that case, a threshold point can be precisely located and all instances have the guarantee to be hard at the threshold, i.e., to have an exponential tree-resolution complexity. Next, a formal analysis shows that it is possible to generate forced satisfiable instances whose hardness is similar to unforced satisfiable ones.

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a random CSP model, called Model GB, which is a natural generalization of standard Model B. This paper considers Model GB in the case where each constraint is easy to satisfy. In this case Model GB exhibits non-trivial behaviour (not trivially satisfiable or unsatisfiable) as the number of variables approaches infinity. A detailed analysis to obtain an asymptotic estimate (good to 1 + o(1) ) of the average number of nodes in a search tree used by the backtracking algorithm on Model GB is also presented. It is shown that the average number of nodes required for finding all solutions or proving that no solution exists grows exponentially with the number of variables. So this model might be an interesting distribution for studying the nature of hard instances and evaluating the performance of CSP algorithms. In addition, we further investigate the behaviour of the average number of nodes as r (the ratio of constraints to variables) varies. The results indicate that as r increases, random CSP instances get easier and easier to solve, and the base for the average number of nodes that is exponential in n tends to 1 as r approaches infinity. Therefore, although the average number of nodes used by the backtracking algorithm on random CSP is exponential, many CSP instances will be very easy to solve when r is sufficiently large.},

For random k-SAT this phenomenon will occur when k {$\geq$} 5 . It is further shown that this threshold point is also a singular point with respect to r in the asymptotic estimate of the second moment of the number of solutions.

We extend this work by training separate hardness models for each class, predicting the probability that a novel instance belongs to each class, and using these predictions to build a hierarchical hardness model using a mixture-of-experts approach. We describe and analyze classifiers and hardness models for four well-known distributions of SAT instances and nine high-performance solvers. We show that surprisingly accurate classifications can be achieved very efficiently. Our experiments show that hierarchical hardness models achieve higher prediction accuracy than the previous state of the art. Furthermore, the classifier's confidence correlates strongly with prediction error, giving a useful per-instance estimate of prediction error.},

We leverage new model-building techniques such as censored sampling and hierarchical hardness models, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by building a portfolio of state-of-the-art SAT solvers and evaluating it on several widely-studied SAT data sets. Overall, we show that our portfolio significantly outperforms its constituent algorithms on every data set.

We empirically explore a case study, Conjunctive Query Containment, and show how common data generation techniques generate biased datasets that lead practitioners to over-estimate model accuracy.

Developing and evaluating practical SAT solvers relies on extensive empirical testing on a set of real-world benchmark formulas. However, the availability of such real-world SAT formulas is limited. While these benchmark formulas can be augmented with synthetically generated ones, existing approaches for doing so are heavily hand-crafted and fail to simultaneously capture a wide range of characteristics exhibited by real-world SAT instances. In this work, we present G2SAT, the first deep generative framework that learns to generate SAT formulas from a given set of input formulas. Our key insight is that SAT formulas can be transformed into latent bipartite graph representations which we model using a specialized deep generative neural network. We show that G2SAT can generate SAT formulas that closely resemble given real-world SAT instances, as measured by both graph metrics and SAT solver behavior. Further, we show that our synthetic SAT formulas could be used to improve SAT solver performance on real-world benchmarks, which opens up new opportunities for the continued development of SAT solvers and a deeper understanding of their performance.},

However, most of these protected areas have been designed by considering only charismatic groups of vertebrates and plants, most linked to terrestrial environments. Thus, little is known about how well protected areas perform in representing aquatic biodiversity. This study analyses the suitability of national and European protected area networks (Natural Protected Areas and Natura 2000) in representing such biodiversity. For this purpose, we studied the different components of diversity ({$\alpha$}, {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$}) using water beetles from the Segura River Basin as surrogates of overall macroinvertebrate biodiversity. Our results revealed no significant differences in {$\alpha$}-diversity between protected and non-protected areas. Similarly, we did not find significant differences in {$\beta$} -diversity components (species replacement and nestedness, i.e., differences in among-site richness without species replacement) between protected and non-protected areas. The species replacement contributed more than nestedness to explain overall {$\beta$} -diversity changes. Finally, we found that the {$\gamma$}-diversity component was significantly higher in both protected areas, when compared to an equivalent number of randomly selected locations.},

If furthermore G[R] is k-connected and every element in V is covered by at least m sets in R, then R is a (k, m)-CSC. In this paper, we present two approximation algorithms for the minimum CSC problem, and one approximation algorithm for the minimum (2, m)-CSC problem. Performance ratios are analyzed. These are the first approximation algorithms for CSC problems in general graphs with guaranteed performance ratios.},

  abstract = {Ensemble forecasting is advocated as a way of reducing uncertainty in species distribution modeling (SDM). This is because it is expected to balance accuracy and robustness of SDM models. However, there are little available data regarding the spatial similarity of the combined distribution maps generated by different consensus approaches. Here, using eight niche-based models, nine split-sample calibration bouts (or nine random model-training subsets), and nine climate change scenarios, the distributions of 32 forest tree species in China were simulated under current and future climate conditions. The forecasting ensembles were combined to determine final consensual prediction maps for target species using three simple consensus approaches (average, frequency, and median [PCA]). Species' geographic ranges changed (area change and shifting distance) in response to climate change, but the three consensual projections did not differ significantly with respect to how much or in which direction, but they did differ with respect to the spatial similarity of the three consensual predictions. Incongruent areas were observed primarily at the edges of species' ranges. Multiple stepwise regression models showed the three factors (niche marginality and specialization, and niche model accuracy) to be related to the observed variations in consensual prediction maps among consensus approaches. Spatial correspondence among prediction maps was the highest when niche model accuracy was high and marginality and specialization were low. The difference in spatial predictions suggested that more attention should be paid to the range of spatial uncertainty before any decisions regarding specialist species can be made based on map outputs. The niche properties and singlemodel predictive performance provide promising insights that may further understanding of uncertainties in SDM.},

  abstract = {Error tolerance and attack vulnerability are two common and important properties of complex networks, which are usually used to evaluate the robustness of a network. Recently, much work has been devoted to determining the network design with optimal robustness. However, little attention has been paid to the problem of how to improve the robustness of existing networks. In this paper, we present a new parameter {$\alpha$}, called enforcing parameter, to guide the process of enhancing the robustness of scale-free networks by gradually adding new links. Intuitively, {$\alpha$} {$<$} 0 means the nodes with lower degrees are selected preferentially while the nodes with higher degrees will be more probably selected when {$\alpha$} {$>$} 0. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that when {$\alpha$} {$<$} 0 the attack survivability of the network can be enforced apparently. Then we propose new strategies to enhance the network robustness. Through extensive experiments and comparisons, we conclude that establishing new links between nodes with low degrees can drastically enforce the attack survivability of scale-free networks while having little impact on the error tolerance.},

  abstract = {Internet topology plays a vital role in studying network's internal structure and properties. Currently traceroutebased topology discovery is the main approach to map the network. However, the deployments of probing sources are usually quite costly and complex. Even if the total numbers of sources are the same, the overall coverage of the sampled network may vary significantly for different sources. As a result, it is of great importance for a topology discovery project to select a limited set of probing sources to detect more nodes and links. The aim of this paper is to investigate how to select a fixed set of probing sources to maximize the coverage of the sampled network. We propose a novel logic distance-based method to make source placement decisions. Also we evaluate our approach and compare it with other known methods on real network topology and generated topologies.},
